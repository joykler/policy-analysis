• The OECD Reinforcing Democracy Initiative builds on three pillars: 
preventing and addressing mis- and disinformation; enhancing new modes 
of participation and representation; and building greater capacity for 
national governments to address global challenges 
• A recent study with data from European countries found that the positive 
effect of government’s openness on public trust is affected by people’s 
perception that they can participate and influence political systems 
(Schmidthuber, Ingrams and Hilgers, 2020[130]). Findings from the OECD 
Drivers of Trust Survey show that if people’s feelings of having a say in what 
government does increased by 1 standard deviation point, trust in 
government is estimated to increase by 0.18 and 0.23 points in Norway and 
Finland, respectively (OECD, 2021[4]; OECD, forthcoming 2022[5]). (p37)

• This paper discusses the high-level institutional arrangements put in place 
by governments to manage policy responses to the pandemic, with a special 
focus on CoG’s leading or supporting role in three main dimensions: 
coordination and strategic planning, the use of evidence to inform 
decisionmaking, and communicating decisions to the public 
• According to the Edelman Trust Barometer, although survey respondents in 
11 countries showed a rise in government trust of 65% ‒ the all-time highest 
‒ with trust in business decreasing, they also claimed to prefer hearing 
advice from doctors (80%), scientists (79%), and national health officials 
(71%), rather than local government leaders (61%) and leaders of their 
countries (57%) (Edelman Trust Barometer, 2020[60]) p13 
• Lessons from previous outbreaks have highlighted the importance of 
sharing data and publications in order to build and maintain trust between 
agencies, create preparedness and response systems, and pre-define 
responsibilities of stakeholders (OECD, 2020[39]). (p13) 
• Effective communication can help strengthen citizens’ trust in, and 
engagement with, public policies. It is fundamental in the fight against 
disinformation and misinformation (OECD, 2020[61]) and (OECD, 
2020[62]). Finally, it can help reach specific segments of the population and 
facilitate dialogue with citizens to ensure that policies and services are 
adapted to their needs and respond to their expectations.  (p14)
