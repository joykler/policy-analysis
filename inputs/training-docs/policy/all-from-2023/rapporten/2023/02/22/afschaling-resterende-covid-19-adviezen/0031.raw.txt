• OECD evidence shows that a government’s competence – i.e. its 
Datum 
responsiveness and reliability in delivering public services and anticipating

new needs as they arise – together with the level of integrity, fairness and 
 
openness of its institutions is a strong predictor of public trust (OECD, 
2017[1]). 
• While many factors influence people’s trust and therefore policy outcomes, 
including the economic situation, culture, and personal characteristics and 
preferences, institutional settings, OECD evidence show that the 
performance and reputation of institutions are important and independent 
factors contributing to trust (Bouckaert, 2012[8]; Van de Walle and 
Migchelbrink, 2020[9]; OECD, 2021[4]; OECD/KDI, 2018[3]; OECD, 2017[1]). 
• When these rules disproportionately target specific groups or places, that 
can lead to a reduction of trust in government since people expect 
government institutions to be fair, inclusive and operating in an open and 
transparent way (OECD, 2017[1]). (p14) 
• P16: Maintaining public trust during prolonged periods of crisis: 1) Engaging 
citizens in consultations and focus groups, 2) Bringing the scientific 
community into the communication process, 3) Delivering communication 
that is frequent, transparent and inclusive, 4) Adhering to high ethical 
standards despite accelerated processes and reduced public or legislative 
oversight 
• A focus on government support to people and businesses hit hard by the 
pandemic, targeted in particular to the young, the less-skilled and other 
vulnerable groups, can not only strengthen the economic recovery but 
also avoid a downturn spiral of disengagement, polarisation and social 
unrest. (p18) 
• Evidence from the Latinobarometro shows, for example, that reforms 
aimed at redistributing power and wealth and mitigating social 
inequalities were effective mechanisms for building trust in the long 
term in some Latin American countries. (p18) 
• trust plays a double role as countries move into the recovery. First, a high 
degree of trust is necessary to ensure public institutions’ ability to 
implement ambitious and effective policies that are necessary to rebuild 
and enhance resilience for future crises. Second, lack of trust compromises 
the willingness of citizens and business to respond to public policies and as 
such is a source of instability for a resilient recovery, such willingness could 
be monitored alongside other non-economic risk factors (p18) 
• In Norway for example, the current government has pledged a “trust 
reform” of the public administration, to enhance innovation and 
experimentation in the civil service as a way to rebuild trust and increase 
effectiveness of policies and maintain citizens’ trust (OECD, forthcoming 
2022[5]) (p23) 
• Trust varies across demographic and socio-economic characteristics (p23 en 
verder) 
• The OECD consultative process “Building a new paradigm for public trust” 
(see Box 6) informed three key “lessons learned” from the crisis in terms 
of ensuring public trust in institutions: (p29)
