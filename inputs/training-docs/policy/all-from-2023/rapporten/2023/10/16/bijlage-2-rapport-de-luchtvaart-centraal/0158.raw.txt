There is a clear separation between regulatory 
activities and service provision – no single 
organisation undertakes both activities.
The UK has established a separate regulator 
(Air Safety Support International (ASSI)), for the 
UK’s overseas territories. ASSI is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of the CAA and was set up in recognition 
of the fact that the nature and scope of aviation 
operations in the overseas territories differs 
considerably from those in the UK mainland.
