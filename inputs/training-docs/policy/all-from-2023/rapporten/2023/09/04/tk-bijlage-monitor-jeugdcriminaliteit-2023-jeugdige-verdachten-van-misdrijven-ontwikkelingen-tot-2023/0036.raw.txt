Summary 
Juvenile crime monitor 2023 
Juvenile suspects of offenses; developments until 2023  
Since 2010, the number of minors registered by the police as suspects of crimes has 
more than halved in 2022. The decline in the share of suspects among youths in the 
2010s appears to have stabilised in the most recent years until 2023. There are 
however some fluctuations in the trends when broken down by different population 
groups and backgrounds. Notably, the number of girls in the suspect registrations has 
increased in 2022, as well as the number of juvenile suspects of property crimes, 
mainly shoplifting and drug and weapon offenses. These latter types of offenses 
constitutes a small share of the total number of crimes among juvenile suspects. 
 
The COVID-19 measures in 2020 and 2021 have had a dampening effect on the 
number of juveniles coming into contact with the police. To what extent there is still an 
expected effect in 2022 and later remains unknown and needs further examination. 
Due to the provisional nature of the data in the most recent years (due to ongoing 
cases and backlogs in registration systems) and the potential impact of pandemic 
measures on (recorded) crime rates, it is not yet possible to determine the direction in 
which the trends in the number of juvenile suspects and subsequent criminal 
prosecutions will continue. 
Objective and research question of the study 
The main research question addressed in this study was: What are the developments 
in registered juvenile police suspects in the period from 2010 until 2023? 
Key findings: 
• From 2010 to 2022, the number of juvenile suspects more than halved, but the 
numbers appear to be stabilizing in recent years. In 2022, the number of juvenile 
suspects increased to the level of 2018. The COVID-19 measures presumably had a 
dampening effect on registered juvenile crime in 2020 and 2021. 
• In 2022, 14 out of 1,000 minors (16,800 12 to 18 year olds) were registered as 
suspects of a crime. Among young adults (defined here as 18 to 23 years old), the 
relative number of suspects was higher, with 20 out of 1,000 individuals aged 18 to 
23 (22,800 young adults). 
• Since 2010, the number of minors registered by the police as suspects of crimes 
has more than halved in 2022. The decline in the share of suspects among youths 
in the 2010s appears to have stabilised in the most recent years until 2023. There 
are however some fluctuations in the trends when broken down by different 
population groups and backgrounds. Notably, the number of girls in the suspect 
registrations has increased in 2022, as well as the number of juvenile suspects of 
property crimes, mainly shoplifting and drug and weapon offenses. These latter 
types of offenses constitutes a small share of the total number of crimes among 
juvenile suspects.
