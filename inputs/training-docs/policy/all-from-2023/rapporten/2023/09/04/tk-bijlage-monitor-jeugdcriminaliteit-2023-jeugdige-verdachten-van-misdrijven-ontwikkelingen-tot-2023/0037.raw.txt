• The COVID-19 measures in 2020 and 2021 have had a dampening effect on the 
number of juveniles coming into contact with the police. To what extent there is still 
an expected effect in 2022 and later remains unknown and needs further 
examination. Due to the provisional nature of the data in the most recent years 
(due to ongoing cases and backlogs in registration systems) and the potential 
impact of pandemic measures on (recorded) crime rates, it is not yet possible to 
determine the direction in which the trends in the number of juvenile suspects and 
subsequent criminal prosecutions will continue. 
Research question of the study 
The main research question addressed in this study was: What are the developments 
in registered juvenile police suspects in the period from 2010 until 2023? 
Key findings 
• From 2010 to 2022, the number of juvenile suspects more than halved, but the 
numbers appear to be stabilizing in recent years. In 2022, the number of juvenile 
suspects increased to the level of 2018. The COVID-19 measures presumably had a 
dampening effect on registered juvenile crime in 2020 and 2021. 
• - In 2022, 14 out of 1,000 minors (16,800 12 to 18 year olds) were registered as 
suspects of a crime. Among young adults (defined here as 18 to 23 years old), the 
relative number of suspects was higher, with 20 out of 1,000 individuals aged 18 to 
23 (22,800 young adults). 
• When broken down by different population groups, the developments in recent 
years are similar to the overall trend. However, there are some exceptions. For 
instance, among youths with a Moroccan migration background, a significant 
decrease in juvenile suspects is observed. 
• From 2018 to 2022, there has been an increase in the number of female suspects 
among minors, reaching the level of 2016. Particularly girls were often suspected of 
property crimes such as shoplifting. It should however be noted that girls still 
constitute only a relatively small proportion of the juvenile suspect population. In 
2022, 26% of the minor suspect population were girls, while among young adult 
suspects, 15% were female. 
• Although early school leavers make up a small part of the juvenile and young adult 
population, they are overrepresented in the group of juvenile and young adult 
suspects. Among young adults suspects, the proportion of early school leavers 
decreased by 8% from 2018 to 2021. The trend in the number of early school 
leavers among minor suspects fluctuates. 
• The number of suspects from the lowest-income groups and institutional residents 
decreased significantly among minors and young adults. 
• When broken down by type of crime, the registered crime trends show fluctuations. 
Property crimes, especially shoplifting, are the most common offenses among 
juvenile suspects. In 2022, there was an increase in these offenses compared to 
the previous two years, reaching the level of 2018. The number of juvenile suspects 
involved in (fire)arm and drug offenses remained relatively stable from 2018 to 
2022. 
• The numbers of juvenile suspects are partially based on preliminary data. Due to 
some of the offenses not yet being cleared, backlogs in case processing and the 
system, or due to youth ultimately not being identified as suspects or being found
