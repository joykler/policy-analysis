GRETA GRETA welcomes the considerable efforts made in the Netherlands in the area VenJ 
7 of awareness raising as a form of prevention of [Trafficking in Human Beings] 
and invites the Dutch authorities to plan future actions in the light of the 
assessment of the impact of previous awareness-raising measures. 
GRETA GRETA considers that the Dutch authorities should strengthen their efforts to VenJ 
8 discourage demand for the services of trafficked persons, for all forms of 
exploitation, in partnership with the private sector and civil society.  
GRETA GRETA urges the Dutch authorities to ensure that all victims of trafficking are VenJ 
9 properly identified and can benefit from the assistance and protection 
measures contained in the Convention, in particular by: 
- placing the protection of and assistance to possible victims at the heart of 
the identification system and not linking identification to the prospects of the 
investigation and prosecution; 
- strengthening multi-agency involvement in the decision-making process 
leading to the identification of victims of trafficking, by giving a formal role in 
the identification process to frontline actors such as NGOs, labour inspectors, 
social workers and officials dealing with irregular migrants and asylum 
seekers; 
- improving the detection and identification of child victims of trafficking, 
including by setting up a specific identification mechanism which takes into 
account the special circumstances and needs of child victims, involves child 
specialists and ensures that the best interests of the child are the primary 
consideration.  
GRETA GRETA invites the Dutch authorities to continue and further strengthen their VenJ 
10 efforts to identify victims of trafficking for the purpose of labour exploitation, 
especially among irregular migrant workers, and to detect victims of 
trafficking among asylum seekers, in particular unaccompanied foreign 
minors. 
GRETA GRETA urges the Dutch authorities to ensure that assistance provided to VenJ 
11 foreign victims of [Trafficking in Human Beings] is not linked to investigations 
or prosecutions being pursued.  
GRETA Further, GRETA urges the Dutch authorities to ensure that victims receive VenJ 
12 adequate assistance uninterruptedly from the moment they are identified. For 
this purpose, the Dutch authorities should: 
- avoid any bottleneck between specialised shelters for foreigners (COSM), 
accommodating victims during the reflection period, and follow-up shelters or 
facilities; 
- ensure continuity in the psychological and medical support provided to 
victims after the reflection period, including by clarifying and reinforcing the 
role of regional care coordinators.
