CED The Committee recommends that the State party include an explicit provision VenJ 
33 for the right of victims to know the truth regarding the circumstances of an 
enforced disappearance and the fate of the disappeared person. The 
Committee calls on the State party to adopt the necessary legislative or other 
measures to recognize explicitly the right of persons who have suffered harm 
as the direct result of an enforced disappearance, which occurred in any part 
of the territory, to obtain prompt, fair and adequate compensation and all the 
other forms of reparation, without the need to prove the death of the 
disappeared person, in accordance with article 24, paragraphs 4 and 5, of the 
Convention. 
 
CED The Committee invites the State party to consider reviewing its legislation, VenJ 
35 with a view to incorporating a declaration of absence as a result of enforced 
disappearance, in order to adequately address the legal situation of 
disappeared persons and that of their relatives in areas such as social welfare, 
financial matters, family law and property rights.
