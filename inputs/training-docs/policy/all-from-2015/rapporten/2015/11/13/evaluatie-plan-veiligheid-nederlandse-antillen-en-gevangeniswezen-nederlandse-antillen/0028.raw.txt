Lessons learned 
The following lessons can be learned from the process of the PVNA programmes (in terms of 
both efficiency and effectiveness): 
- Regarding the execution of the three phases: the PVNA programme lacked steering after 
10-10-'10. The available budgets have been spent but the approach was above all pragmat-
ic with less emphasis on efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability. 
- The continuity of persons and institutions throughout the three phases of implementation of 
PVNA has proved invaluable for project formulation, implementation monitoring and preven-
tion of underspending.
