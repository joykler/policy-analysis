FINANCIÃ‹LE EVALUATIE COLLEGE VOOR DE RECHTEN VAN DE MENS 
3. In order to ensure a stable mandate for the members of the national institution, without 
which there can be no real independence, their appointment shall be effected by an official 
act which shall establish the specific duration of the mandate. This mandate may be renew-
able, provided that the pluralism of the institution's membership is ensured. 
Methods of operation 
Within the framework of its operation, the national institution shall: 
(a) Freely consider any questions falling within its competence, whether they are submitted 
by the Government or taken up by it without referral to a higher authority, on the proposal 
of its members or of any petitioner, 
(b) Hear any person and obtain any information and any documents necessary for assessing 
situations falling within its competence; 
(c) Address public opinion directly or through any press organ, particularly in order to publi-
cize its opinions and recommendations; 
(d) Meet on a regular basis and whenever necessary in the presence of all its members after 
they have been duly concerned; 
(e) Establish working groups from among its members as necessary, and set up local or re-
gional sections to assist it in discharging its functions; 
(f) Maintain consultation with the other bodies, whether jurisdictional or otherwise, respon-
sible for the promotion and protection of human rights (in particular, ombudsmen, media-
tors and similar institutions); 
(g) In view of the fundamental role played by the non-governmental organizations in ex-
panding the work of the national institutions, develop relations with the non-governmental 
organizations devoted to promoting and protecting human rights, to economic and social 
development, to combating racism, to protecting particularly vulnerable groups (especially 
children, migrant workers, refugees, physically and mentally disabled persons) or to special-
ized areas. 
Additional principles concerning the status of commissions with quasi-jurisdictional com-
petence 
A national institution may be authorized to hear and consider complaints and petitions con-
cerning individual situations. Cases may be brought before it by individuals, their represent-
atives, third parties, non-governmental organizations, associations of trade unions or any 
other representative organizations. In such circumstances, and without prejudice to the 
principles stated above concerning the other powers of the commissions, the functions en-
trusted to them may be based on the following principles: 
(a) Seeking an amicable settlement through conciliation or, within the limits prescribed by 
the law, through binding decisions or, where necessary, on the basis of confidentiality;
