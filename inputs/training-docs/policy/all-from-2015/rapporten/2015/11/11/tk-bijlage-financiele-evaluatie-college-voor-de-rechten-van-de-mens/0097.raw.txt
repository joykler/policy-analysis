Composition and guarantees of independence and pluralism 
1. The composition of the national institution and the appointment of its members, whether 
by means of an election or otherwise, shall be established in accordance with a procedure 
which affords all necessary guarantees to ensure the pluralist representation of the social 
forces (of civilian society) involved in the protection and promotion of human rights, par-
ticularly by powers which will enable effective cooperation to be established with, or 
through the presence of, representatives of: 
(a) Non-governmental organizations responsible for human rights and efforts to combat 
racial discrimination, trade unions, concerned social and professional organizations, for ex-
ample, associations of lawyers, doctors, journalists and eminent scientists; 
(b) Trends in philosophical or religious thought; 
(c) Universities and qualified experts; 
(d) Parliament; 
(e) Government departments (if these are included, their representatives should participate 
in the deliberations only in an advisory capacity). 
2. The national institution shall have an infrastructure which is suited to the smooth conduct 
of its activities, in particular adequate funding. The purpose of this funding should be to 
enable it to have its own staff and premises, in order to be independent of the Government 
and not be subject to financial control which might affect its independence.
