221. The maintenance of contact with the outside world is essential, not only for the prevention of 
ill-treatment but also from a therapeutic standpoint. The delegation noted that patients could send and 
receive correspondence, have access to the telephone, and receive visits from their family and friends.  
 
 
222. The possibility for patients to address complaints to independent external monitoring bodies 
remains a cornerstone of the basic rights of any involuntarily admitted psychiatric patient.  
 
At Klínika Capriles, the management encouraged patients to resolve their complaints within 
their units but complaints could also be filed with the Complaints Committee which was 
independent of the clinic and offered complaint receipt, mediation and resolution to several health-
care organisations. It had at least four members and investigated and ruled on the merits of a 
complaint; it could also issue recommendations on measures to be taken. The Committee’s 
recommendations are not binding but are generally followed.  
 Complaints are submitted in writing to the Director’s secretary and forwarded to the 
Committee within 24 hours. The CPT considers that complaints should be forwarded to the 
Complaints Committee by an independent person such as the patient’s counsellor. However, at the 
time of the visit, no patient counsellor was in post. 
  
The CPT recommends that complaints boxes be installed in each ward. Further, it 
would like to be informed whether a patient’s counsellor has been appointed and to receive 
information on the number, nature and outcome of the complaints made by involuntarily 
placed patients for the years 2013 and 2014.
