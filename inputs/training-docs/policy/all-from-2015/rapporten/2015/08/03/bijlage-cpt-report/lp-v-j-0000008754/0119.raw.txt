257. There was once again considerable confusion among the prisoners concerning the 
calculation of their respective release dates. Many inmates said that they did not know whether they 
had to serve two-thirds or four-fifths of the sentence, and several alleged that the initial date 
provided to them was changed when they approached it. This is surprising since the current 
Criminal Code of Sint Maarten clearly states in Article 131 that conditional release may be granted 
after two-thirds of sentences exceeding one year and that police detention and remand count 
towards this period. Further, Article 135(2) of the Criminal Code states that conditional release may 
be postponed to a later date or not be granted at all, upon the advice of the parole board. It is 
essential that prisoners be clearly informed of the date at which point they will become eligible for 
conditional release and that the procedures for keeping a person in prison beyond this date are 
transparent and any decision taken reasoned and reviewable, with a copy provided to the prisoner.  
 
 The CPT recommends that all prisoners be accurately informed of their release date 
120
from prison as soon as possible after their admission to prison, in light of the above 
remarks. 
 
 Further, in light of the decision of the Constitutional Court of Sint Maarten of 
8 November 2013, in which it held that limiting the possibility of early conditional release to 
nationals and residents of Sint Maarten was unfair, the CPT would like to be informed whether 
any foreign nationals have been granted conditional release and, if so, under what terms.
