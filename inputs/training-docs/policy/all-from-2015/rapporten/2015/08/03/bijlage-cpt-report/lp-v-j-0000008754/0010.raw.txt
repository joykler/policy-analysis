At the time of the visit, the closed department of the Judicial Youth Institute of Curaçao (JJIC) was 
in a very poor state of repair and offered extremely limited purposeful activities. Further, the report 
is critical of the placement of juveniles in solitary confinement for disciplinary purposes and the 
lack of safeguards surrounding disciplinary sanctions. The CPT welcomes the subsequent closing 
down of this unit and the opening of the new Incastraat unit with eight single-occupancy rooms and 
looks forward to receiving further information on its functioning. 
 
Psychiatric establishments  
 
The CPT’s delegation also undertook targeted visits to the psychiatric department (PAAZ) at Dr 
Horacio Oduber Hospital in Aruba and Klínika Capriles in Curaçao with a focus on involuntarily 
placed patients. Both facilities were considered to be caring, well-run and supportive, therapeutic 
establishments. The conditions at PAAZ were generally good whereas the building housing the 
closed Pico Plata unit at Klínika Capriles was in a state of disrepair and decay.  
 
The procedures regulating involuntary placement at both facilities need to be strengthened, in order 
to ensure independence, impartiality, and objective medical expertise. Patients should have a right 
to be heard and be entitled to legal assistance during such procedures as well as a right to appeal 
any placement decisions. Further, safeguards during placement should be improved, particularly 
with regard to forced treatment and the possibility to address complaints to an independent external 
monitoring body. The provision of a patient’s rights brochure to all patients at Klínika Capriles was 
considered a positive practice. More generally, as neither facility was equipped to accept dangerous 
forensic psychiatric patients and prison is not a suitable environment for them, the authorities are 
requested to provide information on where such patients can be treated.
