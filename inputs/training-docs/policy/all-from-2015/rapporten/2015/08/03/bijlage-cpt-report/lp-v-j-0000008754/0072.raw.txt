Should a person be detained longer than a few days at a police station, he or she should 
be provided with access to activities, such as reading materials, radio, television and increased 
access to outdoor exercise. The longer a person is detained in such conditions, the more 
activities should be provided. 
 
 Further, the CPT would like to be informed of the legal basis used for long-term 
placement in police stations. 
 
 
143. The person who had been detained for eight months at Barber Police Station further stated 
that he had been kept naked in his cell for a period of two weeks in October 2013. He alleged that 
this was punishment following an incident with a police officer, while the official reason provided 
was that this was a protective measure as he was considered to be at risk of committing suicide. 
Such a situation is unjustifiable whatever the scenario. 
 
 
Persons who are deemed to be at risk of suicide should be placed in a cell which has no 
ligature points and provided with rip-proof clothing. Further, the person should be placed under 
constant personal observation and provided with the opportunity to talk to a health-care 
professional.  
 
The CPT recommends that the Cura√ßao authorities draw up a care protocol for all 
detained persons who are deemed to be at risk of suicide while in police custody, taking into 
account the above remarks. 
 
Further, it goes without saying that persons should never be placed naked in a cell 
under any circumstances, let alone as a form of punishment.
