1. Preliminary remarks 
 
 
223. Further to the recent constitutional changes of 2010, criminal legislation on Sint Maarten is 
in a period of transition. A new criminal code was adopted in December 2012 and a draft Caribbean 
Criminal Procedure Code was presented to the respective Ministers of Justice of Aruba, Cura√ßao, 
Sint Maarten and the Netherlands in November 2013 and is pending adoption. Once adopted, this 
Code should apply on all islands of the Caribbean part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In the 
meantime, the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP) in force on Sint Maarten remains the old 
107
Netherlands Antilles CCP of 1996. The legal framework governing the detention of criminal 
suspects by the police has therefore basically remained unchanged since the CPT's 2002 visit.  
 
In short, persons suspected of having committed a criminal offence may be held by the 
108
police for questioning for a maximum of six hours. Thereafter, if the needs of the investigation so 
require, the person may be placed in police custody for a maximum period of two days 
109
(inverzekeringstelling), on the decision of a prosecutor or of an assistant prosecutor reporting to 
110
the prosecutor in writing or orally as soon as possible and within 24 hours. Police custody may be 
111
further extended by the prosecutor for an additional maximum period of eight days. However, the 
suspect must be brought before the investigating judge as soon as possible - and within 24 hours - 
112
after the beginning of such an extension in order to decide on its lawfulness. Thus the legal 
maximum period before a person deprived of his/her liberty is brought before a judge amounts to 
three days and 16 hours.  
 
Thereafter, a person may be placed in remand detention (voorlopige hechtenis) as regulated 
in Title VIII of the CCP. A maximum of eight days of custody (bewaring) may be ordered by the 
113
investigating judge, renewable once. This detention, however, as well as any further remand 
114
custody (gevangenhouding en gevangenneming), should take place at a remand facility under the 
115
responsibility of the head of that facility; that is, at Point Blanche Prison. 
 
The CPT considers that a person should be kept in police custody for the shortest amount of 
time possible, preferably less than 24 hours. To this end, it recommends that the Sint Maarten 
authorities amend the draft CCP accordingly.
