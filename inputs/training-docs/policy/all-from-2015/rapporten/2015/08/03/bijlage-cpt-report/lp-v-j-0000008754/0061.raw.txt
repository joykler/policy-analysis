116. A leaflet containing basic information on the house rules of the admission unit existed 
(including inter alia information on meals, treatment, visiting times for patients). However, the 
leaflet did not refer to issues such as consent to treatment, access to legal assistance or how to file 
complaints. Further it was not systematically provided to patients.  
The CPT recommends that the leaflet at the PAAZ admission unit be revised in light of 
the comments above. Patients unable to understand the information leaflet should receive 
appropriate assistance. 
 
 
117. The maintenance of contact with the outside world is essential, not only for the prevention of 
ill-treatment but also from a therapeutic standpoint. Patients should be able to send and receive 
correspondence, to have access to the telephone, and to receive visits from their family and friends. 
Confidential communication with a lawyer should also be guaranteed.  
 
All these requirements seemed to be met. In particular, the CPTâ€™s delegation noted that 
patients had the right to receive visitors every afternoon for one to two hours, and that they were 
permitted to make two telephone calls a day, including by mobile phone if they possessed one. 
 
 
118. The possibility for patients to address complaints to independent external monitoring bodies 
remains a cornerstone of the basic rights of any involuntarily admitted psychiatric patient. However, 
besides being able to address complaints internally to the PAAZ management and to the hospital 
complaints department, the delegation was informed that there was no independent monitoring body 
either visiting PAAZ or dealing with complaints. 
 
 The CPT recommends that the Aruban authorities ensure that specific arrangements 
exist enabling patients to lodge formal complaints with a clearly designated body, and to 
communicate on a confidential basis with an independent outside authority.
