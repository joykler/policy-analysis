Dear Mr Kuijer, 
 
In pursuance of Article 10, paragraph 1, of the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture 
and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, I have the honour to enclose herewith the 
report drawn up by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) following its visit to the Caribbean part of the Kingdom 
th
of the Netherlands from 12 to 22 May 2014. The report was adopted by the CPT at its 85 meeting, 
held from 3 to 7 November 2014. 
 
The various recommendations, comments and requests for information formulated by the CPT are 
highlighted in bold in the body of the report. As regards more particularly the CPT’s 
recommendations, having regard to Article 10, paragraph 1, of the Convention, the Committee 
requests the Dutch authorities to provide within six months a response giving a full account of 
action taken to implement them. 
 
The CPT trusts that it will also be possible for the Dutch authorities to provide, in the above-
mentioned response, reactions to the comments and requests for information formulated in this 
report. 
 
I am at your entire disposal if you have any questions concerning either the CPT’s report or the 
future procedure. 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
 
Lәtif Hüseynov 
President of the European Committee for the  
Prevention of Torture and Inhuman  
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
