The Law Enforcement Council cooperates with the Dutch Inspectorate for Security and 
Justice and makes use of its assessment framework. The Inspectorate, however, plays no role in the 
actual inspections. It is recalled that OPCAT has not been extended to the BES-Islands and that the 
Dutch NPM has no mandate to inspect these islands (see paragraph 10). 
 
 The CPT would like to receive comments from the Dutch authorities on how it plans to 
ensure independent inspections of places of deprivation of liberty in these BES-Islands are 
carried out on a regular basis.
