F. National Preventive Mechanism 
 
 
10. The Netherlands ratified the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention against 
Torture (OPCAT) in September 2010. Since December 2011, four bodies are designated as National 
Preventive Mechanism, namely the Inspectorate of Security and Justice (also acting as coordinating 
body); the Health Care Inspectorate; the Inspectorate for Youth Care; and the Council for the 
Administration of Criminal Justice and Protection of Juveniles.  
 
 However, at present, ratification only applies to the Kingdom in Europe, which means that 
the Caribbean part of the Kingdom is currently not bound by this Protocol and the Dutch NPM does 
not have a mandate to visit places of deprivation of liberty on these six islands. 
 
The CPT would like to be informed whether consideration is being given to extending 
the territorial application of OPCAT to the BES islands as well as to Aruba, Cura√ßao and Sint 
Maarten.
