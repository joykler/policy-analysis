I. INTRODUCTION 
 
 
A. Dates of the visit and composition of the delegation 
 
 
1. In pursuance of Article 7 of the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (hereinafter referred to as “the Convention”), a 
delegation of the CPT carried out a visit to the Caribbean part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands 
from 12 to 22 May 2014. The visit was one which appeared to the Committee “to be required in the 
circumstances” (cf. Article 7, paragraph 1, of the Convention). 
 
 
2. The visit was carried out by the following members of the CPT:  
 
- Wolfgang HEINZ (Head of the delegation)  
 
- James McMANUS  
 
- Olivera VULIC  
 
- Hans WOLFF 
 
They were supported by Hugh CHETWYND (Head of Division) and Berber BIALA-HETTINGA 
of the CPT’s Secretariat and were assisted by: 
 
- Vivian LEBLANC (interpreter) 
 
- Manuel MADURO (interpreter) 
 
- Karel THIJS (interpreter). 
 
 
B. Context of the visit and constitutional structure 
 
 
3. During the previous CPT visit in 2007, the Kingdom of the Netherlands consisted of three 
countries: the Netherlands, Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles. The Netherlands Antilles was 
formed by the islands Bonaire, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, Sint Eustatius and Saba. Between 2000 and 
2005, however, all the islands of the then Netherlands Antilles held referenda on the status of each 
island within the Kingdom and all the islands except Sint Eustatius voted for dissolution of the 
Netherlands Antilles. The Netherlands Antilles ceased to exist when the amended Charter for the 
Kingdom of the Netherlands entered into force, on 10 October 2010. 
 
In the new constitutional structure, in accordance with the outcome of the referenda, 
Curaçao and Sint Maarten have acquired the status of countries within the Kingdom, making them 
full, autonomous partners within the Kingdom. Aruba retained the separate country status it had 
already had since 1986.
