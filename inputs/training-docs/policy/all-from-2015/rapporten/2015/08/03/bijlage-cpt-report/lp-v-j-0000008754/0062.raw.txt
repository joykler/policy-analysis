1. Preliminary remarks 
 
 
119. Further to the recent constitutional changes, criminal legislation on Curaçao is in a period of 
transition. A new Criminal Code was adopted in November 2011 and a draft Criminal Procedure 
Code was presented to the respective Ministers of Justice of Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten and the 
Netherlands in November 2013 and is expected to be submitted to the respective parliaments in 
2015. Once adopted, this Code should apply on all islands of the Caribbean part of the Kingdom of 
the Netherlands. In the meantime, the old Netherlands Antilles Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP) 
62
of 1996 remains in force on Curaçao. The legal framework governing the detention of criminal 
suspects by the police has therefore basically remained unchanged since the CPT's 2007 visit.  
 
In brief, persons suspected of having committed a criminal offence may be held by the 
63
police for questioning for a maximum of six hours. Thereafter, if the needs of the investigation so 
require, the person may be placed in police custody for a maximum period of two days 
64
(inverzekeringstelling), on the decision of a prosecutor or of an assistant prosecutor reporting to 
65
the prosecutor in writing or orally as soon as possible and within 24 hours. Police custody may be 
66
further extended by the prosecutor for a further maximum period of eight days. However, the 
suspect must be brought before the investigating judge as soon as possible - and within 24 hours - 
67
after the beginning of such an extension in order to decide on its lawfulness. Thus the legal 
maximum period before a person deprived of one’s liberty is brought before a judge amounts to 
three days and 16 hours.  
 
Thereafter, a person may be placed in remand detention (voorlopige hechtenis) as regulated 
in Title VIII of the CCP. A maximum of eight days of custody (bewaring) may be ordered by the 
68
investigating judge, renewable once. This detention, however, as well as any further remand 
69
custody (gevangenhouding en gevangenneming), should take place at a remand facility under the 
responsibility of the head of that facility; that is, the Centre for Detention and Correction Curaçao 
70
(Sentro di Detenshon i Korekshon Kòrsou or SDKK). 
 
The CPT considers that a person should be kept in police custody for the shortest amount of 
time possible, preferably less than 24 hours. To this end, it recommends that the Curaçao 
authorities amend the draft CCP accordingly.
