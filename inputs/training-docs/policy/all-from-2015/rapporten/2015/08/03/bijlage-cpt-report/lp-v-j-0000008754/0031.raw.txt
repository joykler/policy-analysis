1. Preliminary remarks 
 
 
48. At the time of the 2014 visit, the 1996 Code of Criminal Procedure of Aruba (CCP) 
remained in force. The rules for detaining persons under this Code were described in detail in the 
31
report on the CPTâ€™s visit in 2007.  
 
In brief, persons suspected of having committed a criminal offence may be held by the 
32
police for questioning for a maximum of six hours. Thereafter, if the needs of the investigation so 
require, the person may be placed in police custody for a maximum period of two days 
33
(inverzekeringstelling), on the decision of a prosecutor or of an assistant prosecutor reporting to 
34
the prosecutor in writing or orally as soon as possible and within 24 hours. Police custody may be 
35
further extended by the prosecutor for an additional maximum period of eight days. However, the 
suspect must be brought before the investigating judge as soon as possible - and within 24 hours - 
36
after the beginning of such an extension in order to decide on its lawfulness. Thus the legal 
maximum period before a person deprived of his/her liberty is brought before a judge amounts to 
three days and 16 hours.  
 
Thereafter, a person may be placed in remand detention (voorlopige hechtenis) as regulated 
in Title VIII of the CCP. A maximum of eight days of custody (bewaring) may be ordered by the 
37
investigating judge, renewable once. This detention, however, as well as any further remand 
38
custody (gevangenhouding en gevangenneming), should take place at a remand facility under the 
39
responsibility of the head of that facility; that is, at the Correctional Institute of Aruba (KIA). 
 
The CPT considers that a person should be kept in police custody for the shortest amount of 
time possible, preferably less than 24 hours. To this end, it recommends that the Aruban 
authorities amend the draft CCP accordingly.
