189. The Law Enforcement Council (Raad voor de Rechtshandhaving) is an inter-country body 
of Curaçao, St. Maarten and the Netherlands. The Council is charged with the general inspection of 
the effectiveness and quality of several agencies and institutions of the judicial systems of Curaçao, 
Sint Maarten and Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba. The Council also monitors the effectiveness and 
quality of judicial cooperation between Curaçao, Sint Maarten and the Netherlands, in so far as the 
BES-Islands are concerned. While it has a mandate to perform inspections, it does not perform 
regular visits to all places where persons may be deprived of their liberty. Rather, inspections of the 
different institutions under its mandate are carried out on a thematic basis, with priorities decided 
annually. The CPT was informed that an inspection to SDKK had recently been carried out and that 
a report was being drafted. The CPT would like to be provided with a copy of this report.
