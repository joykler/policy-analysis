208. When a detainee at Illegalen Barakken is in need of medical care, he or she will be seen by 
medical staff from SDKK. There were no regular visits or check-ups performed by medical staff. 
The persons interviewed indicated that they had not undergone any medical screening upon 
admission. 
 
The CPT recommends that systematic medical screening of all immigration detainees, 
including for transmissible diseases, be introduced. Such screening should be carried out in a 
way that respects medical confidentiality (see also paragraph 167). 
 
 
209. Contact with the outside world was limited, as visits were not allowed. Staff indicated that 
exceptions were made for detainees who stay longer than a month. Detainees had access to the 
phone during the hours they were allowed outside their cells. The costs, however, had to be covered 
by detainees themselves. 
 
The CPT recommends that all immigration detainees be granted the right to receive 
visitors, in particular relatives and representatives of relevant organisations, throughout the 
period of their detention.
