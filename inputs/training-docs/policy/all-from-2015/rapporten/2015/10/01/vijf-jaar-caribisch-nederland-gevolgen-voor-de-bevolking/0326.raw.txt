lowed the questionnaire from the survey. Three focus groups were held in Bonaire (includ-
ing one specially for parents of school-age children), and two in both Sint Eustatius and
Saba.
Figure S.1 shows the improvements and deteriorations as perceived by citizens in the areas
of education, health care, public safety and standard of living. The question put to
respondents was: ‘Do you have the feeling that [policy domain] has got (much) better,
stayed the same or got (much) worse since 10 October 2010?’. The figure reveals wide dif-
ferences between the different policy domains, as well as some differences between the
islands.

The picture is most favourable for health care, closely followed by education. This picture
corresponds with the investments made by the Dutch government in these sectors (see
table S.1). Around 60% of respondents feel that health care has (greatly) improved, while
around 15% believe it has (greatly) deteriorated. The differences between the islands are
very small. As regards education, roughly 50% of respondents feel the situation has
(greatly) improved and around 20% feel it has (greatly) deteriorated. Here again, the differ-
ences between the islands are small and not statistically significant. Respondents’ views
