The funding provided by the central government in the Netherlands was nominally a factor
of 3.1 higher in 2014 than in 2010 (a factor of 2.8 if price inflation is included). The biggest
increase was in expenditure on health care (a factor of 6.3) and infrastructure and economy
(5.5). The Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment provided little by way of additional
funding, which increased by 10% over the course of four years after adjustment for infla-
tion. These differences in resources deployed reflect differences in the starting situations in
the different policy domains, as well as differences in the principles adopted by ministries
in determining what constitutes raising facilities to levels acceptable within the Nether-
lands. Incorrect estimations of the starting situation in 2010 also account for some of the
differences in expenditure over the period (the ’Havermans framework’).
How has the level of facilities developed?
In this section we address the following questions.
– What has been the contribution of the public bodies, central government and other
relevant actors to the development of facilities?
– How has the distribution of responsibilities between the public bodies and central
government functioned in respect of the development of the level of facilities? And
what was the level of cooperation in this regard?
1 Education
Prior to the transition on 10 October 2010, the Dutch Inspectorate of Education visited all
schools in Bonaire, Saba and Sint Eustatius. Virtually all publicly funded schools or school
departments were classified as weak or very weak according to the educational quality cri-
teria applied by the Inspectorate; in the Netherlands, they would have been placed in spe-
cial measures. The list of shortcomings was long and applied fairly generically to all schools
on the islands. The conditions necessary for delivering good education were absent; atten-
