are less positive regarding the trend in public safety on the islands, and above all regarding
the development of their purchasing power. There are differences between the islands as
regards public safety; in Bonaire, around 20% of respondents believe public safety on the
island has improved; the figures for Sint Eustatius and Saba are 30% and just under 40%,
respectively. Residents of Bonaire, in particular, thus feel that public safety has deteriora-
ted.
The majority of respondents on all islands feel that the purchasing power of household
income has got worse or much worse: just over 70% of respondents hold this view, 20%
see no change and around 10% perceive an improvement. Most island residents thus
believe that their purchasing power has fallen since 10 October 2010. The variation across
the different population groups is small.
As these opinion surveys have also been carried out in the past, comparisons with earlier
years are possible for some topics. We made comparisons with 2011 (the first opinion sur-
vey) and 2013 (the third survey). The 2011 survey can be seen as a sort of baseline measure-
ment, in which public expectations for a better future figure strongly. The 2013 survey can
be regarded as an interim measurement midway through the evaluation. At that time,
many central government provisions were in the process of being developed and the con-
tours of the anticipated level of facilities were becoming clear.
In 2011, almost half the population of Bonaire and Saba believed that things on their island
had improved following the transition (figure S.2), and a third of residents of Sint Eustatius
shared this view. However, the positive opinions about the transition have fallen sharply in
2015. Only 12% of the population of Sint Eustatius believe that things have improved on
their island since 10 October 2010 (compared with 32% in 2011); 25% take a positive view in
Bonaire (47% in 2011), and 35% in Saba (47%in 2011).
