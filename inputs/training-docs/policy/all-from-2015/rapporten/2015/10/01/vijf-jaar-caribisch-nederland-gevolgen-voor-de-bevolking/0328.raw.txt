Over the last two years, the positive expectations about the future of the islands have
clearly moderated (figure S.3), especially in Sint Eustatius and Saba, but also in Bonaire.
A minority of the island populations believe things will get better over the next five years.
Where 60% of the population of Bonaire believed in 2013 that life on their island would
improve over the coming five years, this had fallen to 48% in 2015. In Sint Eustatius the
percentage fell from 57% to 24%, and in Saba from 65% to 39%. The proportion who
believe that everything will stay the same has grown strongly, especially in Sint Eustatius,
and also in Bonaire, The explanations given for these views make clear that this is not
meant in a positive way.
