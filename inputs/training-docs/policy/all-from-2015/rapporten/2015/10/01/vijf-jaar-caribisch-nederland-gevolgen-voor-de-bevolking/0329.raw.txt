How well does the public administration perform in the eyes of island residents?
The answer is: not very well. In the opinion surveys we draw a distinction in public admin-
istration between the local administration, the National Office for the Caribbean Nether-
lands (rcn) and the government in The Hague. The scores awarded are below par in many
cases (figure S.4).
