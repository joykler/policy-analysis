Inspectie voor de Gezondheidszorg  
 
7 Summary 
The Dutch Health Care Inspectorate (Inspectie voor de Gezondheidszorg, IGZ) 
produces an annual report with statistical information about terminations performed 
in the Netherlands during the preceding year, specifically those which take place 
o
during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. 
Further to the provisions of the Termination of Pregnancy Act 1984 (Wet afbreking 
zwangerschap, WAFZ), all licensed hospitals and abortion clinics are required to 
submit a quarterly report to the Inspectorate. Registration may therefore be 
assumed to have 100% coverage.
