Jaarrapportage 2014 van de Wet afbreking zwangerschap | oktober 2015 
In 4.4% of cases, the patient’s decision to terminate the pregnancy was based on 
the results of prenatal diagnostics. 
The number of teenage patients undergoing a termination was 3,181, nearly 13% 
fewer than in 2013, with 96 procedures performed on girls aged 15 or under. 
 
Care provision 
Although the percentage of terminations performed in a hospital is slowly 
increasing, the majority (91%) of procedures were carried out in licensed abortion 
clinics. 
 
The number of ‘medication abortions’ rose compared to previous years. This is 
especially true of early-stage procedures, 42% of which relied on medication (the 
‘abortion pill’). Of all terminations, 80% were conducted under some form of 
anaesthesia, with intravenous anaesthesia or sedation accounting for over half of all 
procedures performed. Complications were seen in 2.2% of procedures, most 
involving incomplete abortion (retention of placenta) and/or haemorrhage (profuse 
or prolonged bleeding).
