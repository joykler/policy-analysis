The Permanent Mission of Israel to the United Nations presents its compliments to the Secretary-
General of the United Nations, in his capacity as depositary to the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities, and refers to the communication by the depositary, dated 9 April 2014, 
regarding the Palestinian request to accede to this Convention (Reference number 
CN.186.2014.TREATIESIV.15). 
'Palestine' does not satisfy the criteria for statehood under international law and lacks the legal 
capacity to join the aforesaid convention both under general international law and the terms of 
bilateral Israeli-Palestinian agreements. 
The Government of Israel does not recognize 'Palestine' as a State, and wishes to place on record, 
for the sake of clarity, its position that it does not consider 'Palestine' a party to the Convention 
and regards the Palestinian request for accession as being without legal validity and without effect 
upon Israel's treaty relations under the Convention.
