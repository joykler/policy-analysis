direct his or her actions. In restricting the rights of the persons with restricted active legal capacity

The European Community states that pursuant to Community law (notably Council Directive 
2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in 
employment and occupation), the Member States may, if appropriate, enter their own reservations 
to Article 27(1) of the Disabilities Convention to the extent that Article 3(4) of the said Council 
Directive provides them with the right to exclude non-discrimination on the grounds of disability 
with respect to employment in the armed forces from the scope of the Directive. Therefore, the 
Community states that it concludes the Convention without prejudice to the above right, conferred 
on its Member States by virtue of Community law.
