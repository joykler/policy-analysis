Dumping
of munition was mainly performed using Craft
Landing Tanks (LCTs)
with en average bad
of about 220 ton. Dumping started after the vessel had
anchorect and stabilized in the current, consequently
resulting in roughby 150
piles of dumped
munition at IJmuiden and 100 piles at Hoek of Holland; since
the munition articles are accordingly in close
proximity withiri one pile,
sympathetic detonation
within one pile (not between piles) may occur.
A study of
the areas shows that the munition dump sites off IJmuiden and of
Hoek
Holland are situated some 40
30 to kilometres off shore. The water depth at the
munition dump site
IJmuiden is between 21 to 23 m, and at Hook of Holland
19 to
26 m. The bottom morphology
comprises soft seabeds, send waves with a wave
length
of a few hundred meters and a typical height of
several meters, with smaller
waves in between. Sonar plots demnonstrate
that only a tiny fraction of the munition
is not covered by sand. Based on local send wave munition
heights, the lies at a
depth of at least 23 and
25 m at the dump sites of IJmuiden and Hook of Holland
respectively. The distance between the keel of vessel the
the and munition is about
10 meters when vessel
the is situated above the munition. For the scenarios bottom
trawling
and dragging of anchor, the distance
between the keel and the munition
increases 100
to about m.
Risk assessment
methodology
The risk is quantifîed qualitatively by multiplying
likelihood and effect per scenario.
The overall
likelihood of an underwater detonation is composed likelihood
of the of
exposure of shipping
related incidents to the munition dump area, the likelihood of
interaction
with munition and the likelihood munition
of a reaction:
The exposure
is based on probability calculations of shipping lncidents at or
neer the dumping areas by the Marine Research
Institute (MARIN);
The likelihood
of interaction with munition is assessed:
— for direct impact by relating
the areal density of the munition piles with the
dimensions
of the ship, anchor, trawling gear or dropped cargo;
— for indirect contact via turbulence
vibration om on the basis of the distance
between
ship/propeller and seabed and propeller characteristics;
• The Ijkelihood of
munition reaction is assessed:
— for munition deformation scenarios comparing these known
by against
initiation thresholds
for impulse per unit area and energy per unit area;
— for initiation of fuze systemns in view of safety regulations
for transport and
handling at
the time of dumping.
The effects of
an underwater expbosion are quantitatively assessed based en the
size of the explosion and its vessel,
distance to the the type of ship and type of
cergo.
The effects per scenario are determined based on maximum
a credible
threat in the order of 10,000
Rg TNT. This threat is conservatively estimated by
assuming
that two-thirds of a single munition pile sympathetically detonates
in high
order in casa
one munition item Is initiated.
All risks assessments
are categorized in line with the Fine & Kinney niethod using
quabitative terms. The above-water effects
of the explosion such as air blast,
fragmentation
and tidal wave, are negbigible compared to the underwater
effects of
the expbosion.
