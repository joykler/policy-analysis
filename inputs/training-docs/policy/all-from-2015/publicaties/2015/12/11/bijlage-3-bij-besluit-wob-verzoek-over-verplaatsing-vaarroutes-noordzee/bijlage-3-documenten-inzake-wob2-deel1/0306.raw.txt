Amendment of the proposed route
structure of November 21, 2011
The QRA in this report is based on the layout of the route structure of September 16,
2011. As described in Chapter 8.3, the locations of wreck HY2166 the new Deep
in
Water arichorage area has to be avoided. Furthermore was
some extra space desirable
for the ships using the to
IJ-geu? pick up the pilot in the approach area. This has resulted
in an amendment of the proposed route structure in the approach area to the IJ-geul. In
fact the present layout has been incorporated in the proposed structure. The
route
amendment only has a slight effect on the
results of the QRA, but no effect on the
conclusions the
of QRA that can be drawn. By this amendment the wreck HY2168 will
not be located in the anchorage area any longer, but remains in the approach area to
the IJ-geul where the guaranteed water depth is 21 ,5m LAT, thus 20 cm more than is
available above the wreck. The
new layout is presented in Figure 11-1.
