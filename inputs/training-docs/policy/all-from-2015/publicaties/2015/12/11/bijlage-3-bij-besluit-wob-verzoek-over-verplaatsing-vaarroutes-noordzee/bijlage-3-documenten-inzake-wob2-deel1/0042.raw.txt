Sub-Committee considered document NAV 58/614 (Republic
of Korea) outilning
the need
to inciude software quality assurance as part
of the ongoing e-navigation gap and
cost-benefit analysis process that has
to be conducted.
6.14 A majority
of delegations were of the view that software assurance
quality should be
part of the e-navigation
discussion at this session of the Sub-Committee,
whilst others were
of the view that, recognizing time
the constraints, this issue should be deferreci to a later
date.

6.20 The Sub-Comrnittee
considered document NAV 58/6/7 (Denmark and Norway)
commenting
on the report of the CG and providing information on possibilities
future for
exchanging data and information through Data (VDE)
VHF Exchange functionalities rather
than AlS,
6.21
The delegation of Norway clarified that there was no introduce
need to a next
generation AlS. This increased
need could be met through VHF Data Exchange (VDE),
especially since ITU had allocated
frequencies for digital purposes in the VHF band. VDE
was a means seamless
for a and automatic exchange of information, including information
for navigational
safety purposes, leaving the watchkeeping navigator to efficiently
more bring
the ship safely from port A port when operating
to B within the VHF coverage.
The clevelopment of digital (VDE)
VHF might be of beneflt for the development of a single
window system. This
single window system was of great irriportance
in IMOâ€™s work on
reducing
administrative burdens on board ships. 1f a next gerieration was
AlS introduced,
one of the consequences may be that existing need
AlS would to be modifled or replaced
and the original operational
purpose of AlS might be lost. Furthermore, Norway and
Denmark were
of the view that the integrity of the original operational purpose of AlS should
protected.
