A
ship ‘s emergencj’ stoppilig capability
Thefull astern stopping
manoeuvre
The
ship should come to a stop from its full speed in no more
than 15 times its length, though
this may be increased for very large displacement
vessels, such as ULCC’s but in any case it
should not exceed 20 times the
vessel’s length. The stopping distance is to be measured from the
ship’s
position when the full astern order is given to when it is stopped in the
water. This is a
very generous allowance, as manoeuvring trials carried
out on the 193,000 dwt, 305 metre long
steam turbine tanker ‘Esso Bernicia’
showed that even a ship of this size could be stopped in a
considerably shorter distance
than 15 tirnes its own length. Paper 19 presented to the Royal
Institute
of Naval Architects’ 1972 spring meetings showed that 20°/20°
the zig-zag manoeuvre
combined with progressive reductions in the propeller’s
rpm for each reversal of the helm could
bring the ship to a stop from
12.7 knots after only advancing 1620 metres (5.3 times its length)
in the
direction of its original track and with a lateral deviation of 365 metre to port of the track.
However, the builder’s full astern stopping test from the faster
speed of 16.6 knots for the ship in
the loaded condition showed the vessel have
to advanced 5250 metres (17.2 times the ship’s
length) before coming to
a stop with a similar lateral deviation of 320 nietres to port. The two
results
are not directly compatible as the initial speeds differ but the paper estimates that,
1f the
simple full astern stopping test had been carried out at 12.7
knots, then the advance reached by
the time the ship was stopped would have
been about 3000 metres (9.8 times the ship’s length).
