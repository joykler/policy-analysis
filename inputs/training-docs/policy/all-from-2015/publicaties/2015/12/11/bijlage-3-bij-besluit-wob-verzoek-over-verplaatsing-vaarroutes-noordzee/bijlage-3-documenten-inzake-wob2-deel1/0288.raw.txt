Figure 8-5 Probability of hitting the wreck Vinca Gorthon per year as function of the
water depth above
the wreck for the present and proposed route structure
The water depth above
the wreck has changed due to the attempt of salvaging the
Vinca Gorthon. The probability of a contact with the wreck can be read from Figure 8-5.
The actual probability of a contact is less because:
• the operational draft is mostly less than
the design draft;
• the water depth above the wreck is usually greater sounded depth
than the least
to LAT that is indicated on the chart;
Regardless of the actual waterdepth and operational drafts, it can be concluded that the
probability of a contact with the wreck of the Vinca Gorthon is
less for the proposed
route structure than for the flows.
present traffic Figure 8-5 also shows that the
difference
in contact probability is achieved mainly by a lower risk of ramming for the
proposed route structure. The probability of hitting the wreck after a technical failure
(thus, drifting), is much smaller and almost the same structures.
for both route This is
because the probability of ramming is more sensitive The
to the distance. passing
distance for the proposed route structure
is somewhat bigger than for the present traffic
flows.
One would expect that the probability of a contact with the wreck for the present traffic
flows would be higher, because in the present
situation one has to avoid the wreck
located in a traffic route, while
for the proposed route structure no attention at all has to
be
paid to the wreck of the Vinca Gorthon. This phenomenon cannot be modelled
accurately. On the other hand Figure 8-1 shows that nearly all ships have made
a sailing
plan that passes the wreck at sufficient distance. In fact modelled.
this case is
In case the wreck is ignored while
making the voyage plan, the tracks can in the present
route structure initially
run very close to the wreck. In this case the wreck has to be
avoided during the last time period before reaching the wreck. This will result in smaller
passing distances. When modelling this process for of
all ships, the probability hitting the
wreck by ramming is 2.6 times
larger and hitting the wreck by drifting is 1.12 times
larger.
