This 30000 is calculated
by multiplying 2.5 km (the smallest dimension
to
one of
the munitions dumps) with 12 m (the
maximum width of trawling
in the European Union waters). Trawling
only interacts with the top
of

the probability of interaction is approximated by
multiplying the

of divided by the survey

likelihood of bottomtrawling interactwith

likely.

Water turbulence due to
wash disturbs
Water turbulence induced by
propeller wash only disturbs munition that is lying
uncovered on the
bottom. From the survey [Ham
et al., 2001] it is known that
only

may negligible. For a particular tugboat
