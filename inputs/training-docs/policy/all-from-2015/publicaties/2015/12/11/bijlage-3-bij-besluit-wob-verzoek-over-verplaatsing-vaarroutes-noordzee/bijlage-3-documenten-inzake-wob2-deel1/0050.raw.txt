9.5 The Sub-Committee
considered document NAV 58/9 (IACS) providing
an update 0fl
the work had
t undertaken relating to its interpretations
relevant to SOLAS regulation V/22,
IACS had reviewed
both IACS Ul SC 139
and Ul SC 235 and had consolidated the
interpretations into a single IACS
Ul. Accordingly, IACS Ul SC 235 had been updated
and
IACS Ul SC 139 had been
deleted,
In
9.6 light of the foregoing, the
Sub-Committee agreed that there was a need to revise
MSC.1/Circ.1350 with the addition
of an extra paragraph 4 as reflected in annex to
the
document NAV 58/9.
9.7 Having
considered NAV 581WP.9,
the Sub-Committee agreed to the revised
MSC.1/Circ.1350 with minor amendments,
as set out in annex 8 and invited the Committee
to approve it.

OEVELOPMENT OF PERFORMANCE
STANDARDS FOR INCLINOMETERS
10.1 The Sub-Committee
recalled that MSC 88 had agreed to
inciude, in the biennial
agenda of the
Sub-Committee and the provisional
agenda for NAV 57, an unplanned output on
“Development
of performance standards for
inclinometers’, with a target completion year
of 2012 (MSC 88/26, paragraph
23,24).
10.2 The Sub-Committee
recalled also that NAV 57 agreed
that further consideration was
needed whether an electronic inclinometer:
.1 should provide
an indication of the acceleration forces
due to rolling that
could be expected at the place
of installation;
.2 might optionally
provide a warning for parametric and/or synchronous
roll
detection;
.3 might optionally provide
a warning for indicating that a set heel angle had
been exceeded;
.4 should also be capable of operating
from the ship’s main and emergency
source of electrical
power; and
had invited Member
Governments and international organizations
to submit comments and
proposals on the
draft performance standards for
electronic inclinometers (NAV 57/WP.5,
annex 2) to NAV 58, with a view
to finalizing the performance staridards at that session.
Furthermore, the Secretariat had
been instructed to advise the SLF Sub-Committee of
the
work being uridertaken
by the Sub-Committee and request advice
any on appropriate criteria
for alarming
functionality of inclinometers. It also
recognized that it would have to address
provisions in the draft performance standard
relating to power supplies at NAV 58.
10.3 The Sub-Committee
noted that, due to lack of time, SLF Sub-Committee
the was
unable to review the draft performance standards and would
review them only at SLF 55 for
formal adoption by MSC 92.
10.4 The
Sub-Committee considered document NAV (Germany)
58110 containing a
revised
draft performance standard for electronic
inclinometers based on the draft developed
at NAV 57.
