The calculations were performed with SAMSON in which the wreck is modelled as an
object of 85rn long
1 and 37m wide. The probability of a contact with such an object due
to a navigational error (ramming) and due to a technical failure (drifting), is determined,.
Table 8-1 contains the results.

structure
Table 8-1 contains the probabilities of contact with a wreck under the
a that is directly
water surface, which means that all ships will hit the wreck. However, small ships with
limited drafts will not hit the wreck when crossing the wreck, because sufficient water is
available above the wreck. The probability of an actual contact depends on the least
sounded depth, the draft of the vessel and the tide. Generally it can be that
assumed
ships with a draft larger than
a certain value will hit the wreck in case of crossing.
Therefore Table 8-1 contains the cumulative probabilities. For example: the probability
0006222 for the proposed route structure in the column 5000 to 10000 GT means that
the probability of hitting the
wreck of a ship of 5000GT or larger is 0006622, assuming
that ships of this size class have enough draft to hit the wreck.
For each ship size class, the average (is maximum
design draft draft) is determined and
put in Table 8-1.
The operational draft is always smaller than the design draft, which
means that using the design draft will result in an overestimation of the contact
probability. Figure 8-5 is composed based on the design drafts and the probabilities of
Table 8-1 and contains the probability of contact as
a a function of the water depth
above the wreck. The figure should be read as follows. A water depth of, for example,
10,8m above the wreck (the depth indicated in the nautical charts before the salvage
attempt) results in a contact probability of 0,0064 per for the present traffic
year flows,
thus on average
one accident every 1/0,0064 = 156 years. For the proposed route
structure the probability of hitting is 0,0052 a year, thus once every 192 years.
