container is lost per miie, the
estimate of 10000 lost per year is used. This number is related
to
the number
of miles travelled by container vessels per
year, calculated from the shipping
characteristic
database, using an average
speed of 80% of the forward speed, ship for 50%
loaded, 70%
of the time at sea. Further it
is assumed that the probability that a large ship losses
a
container is larger than for a
small container ship. A relationship with the
(TEU is
used which means
roughly that the probability
is related with the length of the ship. When using
this for
rate the NCS this delivers 67 containers
overboard in the NCS per year. This number is
checked
with the number from publication
the [2], in which was published that 217 containers
were lost from 2006-2009
by 11 incidents. This means, in average
54 containers per year by 275
incidents
per year and in average 20
containers per incident. Thus the
container_faliing_rate_pernm
corresponds
with wtiat is observed in the NCS. This rate has been
applied to the ships that cross
the dumping areas near Rotterdam.
The probability of
deck cargo overboard per nautical
miie is not refreshed because data is not
available, but
the probability is much lower
than for a container overboard.
Probability of anchoring
From the AlS-data
of 2010 t can be concluded that
the dumping areas are not used for
anchoring,
as was expected, because
there was no reason to do that just there. However, that
might change for the proposed
route structure because then the dumping
areas of Rotterdam will
be crossed by north going
all ships using the moved Maas North
TSS. The reason is that ships
can meet
technical failures after which some
ships anchor for repairing. An extensive study to the
behaviour of shipping that have anchored
ciose to and within the TSSs near the Wadden
is
researched in [3]. The results
of that study are summarized 0-2.

Table 0-2 teils that in average
24,75 incidents per year will occur in which the ship presents
the
anchor after a technical failure.
In a limited number of incidents the Coastguard
was informed and
was discussed
there about the location where anchor.
to These cases were considered as not
resulting in anchoring above a pipeline. In
all other cases the decision and location to anchor
were taken by the captain. The
last column of the table contains the fraction initial
of the number
of failures that
results in en anchoring in the traffic lane, in the
separation zone and just outside
the
traffic lane. These fractions have been applied
on the failures that will occur in the dumping
areas.
The percentage
of 5% erroneous anchoring is applied to the cases
of Table 0-2, namely to the
cases
without intervention of the Coastguard
and to the (on average) 25% of the cases in which
the Coastguard was not or too late
involved. For example, for the cases ‘in traffic lanes
