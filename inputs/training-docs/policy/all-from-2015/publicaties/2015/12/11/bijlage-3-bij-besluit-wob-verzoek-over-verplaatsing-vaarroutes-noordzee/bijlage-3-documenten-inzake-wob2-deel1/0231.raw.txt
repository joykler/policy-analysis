5.3.2 Mechanical deformation
of munitions
When a munition
is hit by a (sinking) ship or heavy equipment anchor),
the
munition may be into the deformed
a hard pushed
into the deformed
and simultaneously, or
ship or heavy
equipment and other munitions. The
latter is for the
munition
pile dumped from an LOT, where forces will be exerted
through a limited number of contact points
resulting in local deformation.
In the that
deformation occurs, the explosive content of the munition
up
locally.
An ignition of the explosive may
occur depending on its sensitivity to
mechanical stimuli.
Note that this mechanical sensitivity differs from
the shock
sensitivity in the previous
on sympathetic detonation. A
burning reaction
may and turn into a detonation
on the type
and amount of explosive, and the
strength of its confinement. This phenomenon
is
called a DDT
or Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition.
The munition varies in severity
from a no-reaction to burn,
deflagration, explosion
and (partial) detonation. The munition
described in AOP-39. Only the high
order reactions of concern they a
shock wave
in the environment which may initiate nearby munitions

or mechanically the ship. Low

additional wave (not shock wave) the

Small and medium calibre munition
give high order reactions by
deformation. Large
calibre munitions vulnerable to DDT if the explosive
is more
to TNT (e.g.
Composition B). TNT is the most commonly used
type of
explosive during WWII. A condition for the
of a DDT is that the
confinement of the explosive to be intact.
This that for a DDT the
munition
should not be corroded to a were the explosive longer
