Title: Netherlands Formal Assessment
Safety
ARCADIS
Overall, IMO variant 12.12.11 has a significantly
lower level of risk than either of the other
two systems, leading conciusion
to the that the benefits derived from implementation of
the
IMO Variant in terms
of safety of life at sea and improving navigation in
the area is dear
from
the Hazid process and is certainly improvement
an on the present situation. This can,
amongst others, be ascribed to the
following features of the proposed IMO variant routeing
design that mitigate
the above hazards:
1. The approaches to IJmuiden:
Traffic between the Maas North and the Texel traffic
separation schemes directed
is to cross the deep-water route leading to IJmuiden in a
precautionary
area west of the deep-water channel and so deep have
draft vessels room
take
to the proper evasive action in risk of collision
encounters. Furthermore, the traffic
separation scheme in the approaches
to IJmuiden will prevent the crossing encounters
between inbound
and outbound traffic that currently occur, whilst north and
south
going ships cross the scheme in just the two precautionary
areas. This allows for more
anchorage areas on the south side of the separation
scheme so that inbound ships do not
cross the outbound lane when
arriving at or departing from the anchorages.
2.
Entrance to 0ff Texel TSS: In the IMO variant, ships
from the Maas North to the 0ff
Texel traffic separation schernes are directed
to join northeast going traffic about 10
miles southwest of where
they currently do and so the congestion of merging
traffic
that currently
occurs at the south end of the 0ff Texel northeast bound
lane is reduced.
The adjusted boundaries of the 0ff Texel traffic
separation scherne’s northeast bound
traffic lane also puts the Vinca Gorthon
wreck outside of the lane, so effectively
increasing the lane’s
width.
3. Around Horizon platform: In the variant,
lMO the extended southwest bound traffic
lane of the 0ff Texel traffic separation
scheme obliges ships for Schouwenbank via the
amended Maas Junction
precautionary area to continue in the southwest lane
until they
reach
the south bound branch lane, rather than turning south-southwest
as soon as they
exit the current traffic lane. This reduces the
traffic passing through the current ‘hot
spot’ at the Horizon rnanned
oil platform. Furthermore, re-aligning the northeast bound
lane of North
Hinder North traffic separation scheme directs vessels
to pass the
Horizon platform at a greater distance it currently
than does.
4. Maas Centre precautionary
area: Vessels from Maas North TSS for Maas Centre
the
not need
do to turn to starboard to approach the pilot station whilst
being stand on
traffic for outgoing ships. The enlarged Maas
Centre precautionary area also provides
more manoeuvring space for vessels embarking
or disembarking the pilot.
5. Approaches
to and from Hook of Holland: The crossing angle
of N/S going ships
with east/west going traffic in amended
the Maas Junction precautionary area is
improved.

6. At Ridge/ De Ruyter: The recommended from
route the south going branch
directs traffic for Schouwenbank
to cross northeast bound traffic for the 0ff Texel
traffic separation scheme
and northwest/southeast traffic in and out the Maas
