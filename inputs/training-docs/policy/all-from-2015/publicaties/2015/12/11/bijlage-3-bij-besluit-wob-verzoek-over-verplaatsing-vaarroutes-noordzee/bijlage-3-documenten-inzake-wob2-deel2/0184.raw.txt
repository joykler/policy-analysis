• The high
temperatures of large diesel engines running maximum
at power should not be
reduced too suddenly by immediately slowing down,
as this can cause unnecessary stress
to some of its component parts.
• It is often necessary
to start a second steering motor if the
vessel is to respond adequately
to
the helm at reduced speeds.
• The engine room should be manned
series of changes in speed are to be made.
1f the speed of a ship cannot be altered
immediately, then arguably the vessel is not strictly
speaking fully under command
but running at ‘full away’ speed is such common practice
that
few recognise this
point. However, the inabilily or reluctance
to slow down makes avoiding
collision difficult in certain situations and breach
is in ofthis regulation in such circumstances.
Rule 7— Risk of collision
This Rule explains
how a risk of collision is identified, which
can be taken to exist when
another
vessel is viewed on a compass bearing
that is not significantly changing whilst its range
is closing. This can be determined
by either a series of visual sightings using a bridge wing
compass repeater properly
or made observations taken from a compass
stabilised radar.
Rule
8 — Action to avoid collision
Rule 8 states the general principles of how should
actions be carried out to avoid collision (the
specific actions to avoid collision stated
are for all the different scenarios in rules 1 The
— 19).
first part of the Rule requires
the appropriate alteration of course and/or speed
to avert collision
to be in
taken ample time and to be immediately obvious to the
other vessel. ‘Ample time’ must
relate to the size of the vessels involved
because in many of the scenarios one ship must give
way to the other (known as ‘stand
the on’ vessel) which is required by the rules to its
maintain
course and speed
unless any action by the give way vessel alone is
insufficient to avoid the
collision. The
officer on watch on a large tanker that is the
stand on vessel will get distinctly
nervous if a give vessel bas not altered course
by the time the range between the two ships is
down to around 4 miles. yachtsmen,
(Some however, only start to worry when
they can just
about read the name the
on other ship’s how.) Judging what actually
ample time is requires the
application
of good seamanship to whatever situation
the the particular vessels are in.
The requirement that the
give way vessel’s actions are immediately to the
apparent other vessel
favours altering
course to avoid collision rather than slowing down and
this can be problernatic
when in heavy traffic that is moving roughly
in the same direction but converging, such as
when approaching a traffic separation
scheme. This is similar in many ways to a car joining
a
motorway from a slip
road where the joining vehicle is equivalent to give
the way vessel and
must adjust
its speed in the slip road so that it can merge the traffic
with moving along the main
carriage
way without causing potential
a collision situation. Ships require much greater
distances and longer times than
road vehicles for a change in speed to take effect
but the
principle is basically
the same and, officers are not prepared alter
to speed to merge
safely with converging traffic, then avoiding risk collision
of situations becomes more dfficult.
The last part of Rule 8 rather confusingly
requires vessels to take early and positive action to
avoid impeding the safe passage
of other vessels. What this part of the Rule addresses
is the
