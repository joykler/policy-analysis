on some routes, the number
of encounters between ships and therefore the number of
collisions will
also increase.
The construction of the wind farm will also introduce a
new type of accident. Due to
different causes, a ship can
collide with a wind turbine. In the SAMSON model two types
of contacts are distinguished,
a ramming and a drifting contact.
ramming
• A contact takes place when a ship is on collision
a course with a wind
turbine and a navigational error occurs.
A navigational error can have various
causes, like lack of information,
not being able to see the wind farm, not being
present on
the bridge, getting unwell and not being able act,
to making an error
etc. A ramming contact will take place with
high speed: 90% of the service
speed of a vessel.
• A drifting contact occurs when
a ship in the vicinity of a wind turbine
experiences a
failure in the propulsion engine or in the steering equipment.
Since the
ship slowly becomes uncontrollable as it loses speed, the combined
effect
of wind, waves and current may the
carry ship towards the wind turbine. 1f
dropping an anchor does help
not or is not practical and the repair time exceeds
the available time,
the ship may collide against a turbine. This generally happens
at a
low speed.
All these accidents apply to
all shipping near the locatiort of the wind farm, and do not
necessarily only to
apply the ships that are usually sail across location wind
the of the
farm.
In order to be able calculate
to the effects of the wind farm, it is necessary make a
to
“new” traffic database
for the SAMSON-model. All passing
ships have to keep a
distance
of at least 500m from the border of the
wind farm. The number of changes in
the traffic pattern by the wind farm
depends on the location and the size of the wind
farm.
Subsequently,
the different models within
SAMSON are used together with the new
traffic database to carry out
a complete (nautical) risk assessment. This risk assessment
implies the “change”
of risk for the complete shipping near the wind farm
and the “new”
risk being
the probability of colliding against a wind turbine.
Model input
and assumptions
The following model inputs,
assumptions and parameters are used in the calculation.
Traffic
In the calculation, a traffic database is used. traffic
The database contains links, traffic
intensities on the different links
and the link characteristics. A link is defined as a straight
connection between so-called
two waypoints. The traffic intensity of a link describes the
number of ships
sailing on the link per year divided over different ship
types and ship
sizes. The link characteristic connection
of the contains its width and the lateral
distribution of the ships across
the join.
The
maritime traffic is divided into two main groups: route-bound
the ships and the
non-route-bound Cor random) route-bound
shlps. The traffic consists of merchant
vessels and ferries sailing along
the shortest route from one port to another. The non-
