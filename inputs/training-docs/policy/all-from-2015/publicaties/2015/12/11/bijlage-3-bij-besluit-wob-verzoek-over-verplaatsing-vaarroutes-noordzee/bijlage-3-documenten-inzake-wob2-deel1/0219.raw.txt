A summary of the exposure at the munition dump sites Table 6, with
is given in
figures derived from [MARIN, 2011a,b].
The probability of a ship sinking on a
munition dump site is increased by a factor of six for the alternative route structure,
while it decreases to (almost) zero
with the proposed route structure in place to
regulate ship traffic.
The probability of ships anchoring
or dragging an anchor is doubled with respect to
the current situation. The probability for ships loosing cargo at the dump sites is
increased more than tenfold
for the alternative route structure, whereas for the
proposed route structure this probability is actually lower than in present
the
situation.
The probabilities are differentiated
by colours on a relative scale going from
impossible (blue) at the left to frequent (red) at the right. Colour coding is assigned
per decade in probability per
year and a translation is made to qualitative terms in
line with the Fine & Kinney method. Where numbers are absent, colours are
assigned in accordance with
comparable scenarios.
