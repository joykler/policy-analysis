3.7 Estimating the frequency rating ‘F’ for each identified
hazard
The frequency
of an accident occurring for each hazardous encounter was estirnated in the FSA
considering
by the following factors:
(i)
How busy are the traffic lanes are involved in the encounter? (This was roughly estirnated
from the density of ships’ tracks in AlS plot of ship
the rnovements in the area taken over a
three month period.)
(ii) How much sea room is available to
for ships manoeuvre in when taking action to avoid a
collision? (The depth under
the ships’ keels is also relevant to this, as restricted underkeel
clearance
increases a ship’s turning circle.)
(iii) What
speeds are the ships likely to being moving at during the encounter?
(This is closely
related to points (i) and (ii), as ships should be at reduced when
speed manoeuvring is
restricted by either the sea room available
or the depth under the keel or the density of
traffic.)
(iv) How complex is the encounter
in terms of how many ships moving in different directions
could be involved?
(Simultaneous collisions between more than two ships are very rare
but
the actions of ships in close quarters encounters heavily influenced
are often by other
vessels in the immediate vicinity. are often restricted
Ships in the options available to them
when giving way to another
ship because the most preferable evasive action to take would
involve
a close quarters encounter with yet another vessel that is close by.)
(v) What is the aspect
angle of the close encounter? (The MARIN QRA uses the difference
between two vessels’ courses to differentiate between ‘crossing’
‘overtaking’, and ‘head
on’ encounters but the ‘Rule of the Road’ distinguishes
each of these three different types
of close quarters encounter
by the relative bearing (known as the ‘aspect angle’) of each
