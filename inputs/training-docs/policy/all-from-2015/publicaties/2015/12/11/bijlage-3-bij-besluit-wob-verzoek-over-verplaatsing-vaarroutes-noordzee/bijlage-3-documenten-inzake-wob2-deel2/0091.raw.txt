“Q1O”
The following Hazid is based on the following assumptions:

530
2) Loaded tankers of 10,000 dwt trading north of North and moving between IJmuiden and the mandatory deep water route must follow the shortest way possible
and pass west of the Horizon gas platform.
The general control measures applied to reduce the risk of collision and grounding and to minirnise the consequences of such accidents when they occur are contained in
the relevant parts of the following:
International Preventing (COLREGS)
1) “The Regiilationsfor Collisions at Sea”
2) “The International Jonvention for the Safety ofLijè at Sea” (SOLAS)
3) “The International Convention for the Prevention ofPoll,ition from Ships” (MARPOL)
4) “The Offshore Installations RL’gulations” issued by the UK and Dutch governments to the offshore oil and gas industry
The control measures to reduce the risk of collision and grounding that are specific to the present traffic movements are the existing traffic routeing measures (traffic
