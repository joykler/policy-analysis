lack of symbology_for MIO_elements).

Training
1 13-GtrOl FamUiarization to presentation and context of information STW
such as
metadata and all ancillary data to charts.
2 Effective and robust voice
communication and data
transfer
Technlcal
120-GteOl No reference to determine reliability of maritime COMSAR
communication.
Insufficient reliability data/voice
of communications (users
require communication without interference, disruption
and noise).
Lack of rellability standards for communication
technology.
120-GteO2 Possible lack of bandwidth and assignment of adequate NAV/COMSAR
bandwidth for potential e-navigation communication
needs, inciuding short range communication.
120-GteO3 of systems for source
Lack and channel management for NAV/COMSAR
communication equipment.
Lack of seamless cornmunication means for exchanging
navigation information
(eg. intention, alarm, etc.) between
ships.
Insufficient techniques and procedures for exchange of
data between ship, shore and on board.
Insufficient data protocols support
to the exchange of
reliability information describing data and system integrity.
The Identified gap is not withln the remit ci the Organization or any of the relevant Sub-Comrnittees.
