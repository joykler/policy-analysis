Section
III — Conduct of vessels in restricted
visibility.
Rule
19— Conduct ofvessels in restricted visibilily
This
Rule requires vessels in or near
an area of restricted visibility (e.g. a bank,
fog a rain/snow
squall, etc.) to proceed
at a safe speed with regard to the prevailing
circumstances (see Rule 6)
but, in any case,
power driven vessels should have their engines
ready for immediate manoeuvre.
The
master should be informed and measures
appropriate to the circumstances should be
taken,
such as putting a man on the wheel,
posting an extra lookout and/or having an extra
officer on the
bridge so that the radar
can be continually monitored. (SOLAS regulations
require every vessel of
jst
500 gross tonnage
or more and built after September
1984 to be equipped with one radar set,
whilst
vessels of 10,000 gross tonnage or more
must have iwo radar sets and, vessel
was built
]sl
after September 1984, then
the radars must befitted with ARPA (‘automatic
radar plotting,).
Use of the vessel’s whistle is not specifically
mentioned in this Rule but vessels
in or near areas of
restricted visibility make
must the appropriate sound signal, given
as by Rule 35. (Power driven
vessels under way
and making way must make prolonged
one blast at intervals of not more than 2
minutes
and two prolonged blasts same
at the interval when stopped in the The
water.) whistle on
even the largest vessel unlikely
is to be heard at a range greater than 2 nautical
miles, which
reduces to .5 miles
1 for vessels between 200 & 75 metres length
in and to 1 mile for vessels
between
75 & 20 metres in length. Consequently, there
is littie point in sounding the whistle the
1f
visibility
is known to be greater
than the whistle’s audible range.
The Rule
also stipulates that if a vessel is detected
by radar alone, then its compass bearing
and
range must be recorded regular
at intervals to determine whether or not a risk
of collision exists. 1f
such a risk does exist, then
early and substantial action should be
taken to avert the collision,
providing that,
as far as possible, the actiofi does involve
not the following:
• Altering course to port for
a vessel ahead of the beam, other than one overtaken.
being
• Altering
course towards a vessel abeam or abaft the
beam.
Radar targets are
to be observed in the same way if the
as targets were visible, so that a risk of
collision
can beidentified, but the only way to
determine a target’s true course and speed, and
hence decide on the appropriate actions
to take, is to plot it and construct a vector
triangle from
the target’s relative course
and speed and own vessel’s course and
speed. This used to be done
manually a
on paper plotting sheet and then the invention
of a reflection plotter allowed for the
plot
to be done directly onto the radar display with
a china graph pencil. However, most vessels
of
significant size are now equipped
with ARPA radars, 50 targets simply have be
to selected and
radar’s computer does the
rest, though the accuracy of the plot depends
upon the accuracy of the
own ship’s
speed input, which may be manual, or from
a log, or from the ship’s electronic
navigation,
such as GPS. Early and substantial
evasive action is necessary for the action
to be
easily observable on the radar of
the target vessel, so a series of small course alterations
should be
avoided as much as
is possible. Speed alterations are less immediately
obvious than course
alterations
but if a significant change in speed is made
in good time, then it will be observable on
the target’ s radar.
Speed can be reduced quicker
than it can be increased (if it can be significantly increased
at all)
and reducing speed
early will allow more time to resolve
a collision situation in most
circumstances.
