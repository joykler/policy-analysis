the overtaking vessel must allow sea room
it to do so. This should be remembered
because,
although the Rule not
does specify which way the overtaking vessel should
alter course to keep
dear, many watch keeping
officers seem to believe altering to starboard
is the practice of good
seamanship.
However, this will depend on circumstances,
the as blocking the other vessel from
also altering course to starboard could put
it in an awkward situation with crossing
traffic, as
will become evident with Rules
14 and 15. 1f the faster ship cannot overtake
without putting the
slower vessel in hazard,
then it must slow down.
The Rule defines overtaking
an vessel as one that is closing its range
with another vessel from a
direction of more than 22.5° abaft the slower vessel’s
beam. It should always be appreciated
that ships can encounter each from
other any direction in open waters but, nevertheless,
It
seems strange that another
vessel approaching one’s own ship from
abaft the beam, but by Iess

than 22.5 is regarded
as crossing rather than overtaking,
as it will be the faster ship ifthere is
0
a risk of collision. The origin of the 22.5
abaft the beam seems to be lost in the mists time.
of
Rules 13 also states that if watch
the keeper of a vessel is in any doubt that
his ship is
overtaking another,
then he should assume that it is and keep dear.
No subsequent change in
the relative
bearing between the two vessels can relieve
the obligation of overtaking vessel to
keep dear until It well past the overtaken
vessel.
Rule 14 — head on situation
1f two vessels on reciprocal
or near reciprocal courses encounter each
other so as to create a
risk of
collision, then each shail alter course to starboard
so that they pass on the port side of
each other. Near reciprocal’ is usually
taken to mean that each vessel sees the other within
about 3° off right ahead with
masts almost aligned or both its red and green sidelights
in view.
Rule 15 — Crossing situation
1f two power
driven vessels are crossing with a risk of
collision, then the vessel with the other
on its starboard side shail keep dear and,
as far as possible, avoid passing ahead of other
the
vessel. Vessels are deemed to
be crossing ifeach sees the other from a direction of
about 3° off
the bow (if in doubt,
assume a head on situation and obey Rule
14) to 22.5 ° abaft the beam.
Rule 16 — A
ction ofthe give way vessel
This
Rule states that to avoid collision, the way
give vessel shall, as far as possible, take early
and substantial action that is
easily observable from the stand on vessel. This
is usually
interpreted as altering
course to starboard to put the stand vessel on
the port side and then, as
the bearing
of the stand on vessel opens to port (i.e.
it is seen moving further around from the
give way vessel’s bow), then the give way
vessel can come back slowly to its original course
whilst clearing the stand on
vessel’s stem to port at a reasonable distance.
This is fine in
crossing situations
where the stand vessel is viewed well forward
of the beam, particular in
open
seas because the stand on vessel clearly sees
the action as safe. However, if the stand on
crossing vessel is viewed close to abeam,
then the alter course required is large and initially
involves aiming almost at
the stand on vessel, which can be somewhat
alarming in confined
waters, particularly
if there is heavy traffic about. The alternative of
slowing down to allow the
stand
on vessel to pass ahead is less immediately
obvious to a visual observer, but it may be the
