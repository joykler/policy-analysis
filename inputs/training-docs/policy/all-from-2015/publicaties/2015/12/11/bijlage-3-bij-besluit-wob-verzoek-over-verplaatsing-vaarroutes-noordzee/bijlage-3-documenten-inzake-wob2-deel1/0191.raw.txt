Deliverables and
rationale of risk
The purpose of the risk analyses
is to determine whether the safety of shipping in
area
the of the munition dumps could be hazardous, to recommend
appropriate risk
mitigating measures and these
to relate measures to corresponding levels of risk.
The overall likelihood and effects are therefore assessed
and compared for the
above mentioned different structure
route scenarios, incident scenarios and a
number
of risk mitigating policies.
Recommended risk mitigating
measures
The risk analyses have lead
TNO to recommend the following risk mitigation
measures for the dump sites off Ijmuiden and Hook of
Holland (or similar nautical
meas u res):
•
Selection of the “proposed route struöture”;
• The munition dump areas should
be clearly marked out by buoys with relevant
indications;
• The munition dump areas should
be clearly marked on nautical charts as
ProhibitedAreas
for ships with explosive cargo and with
vessels a draught of
more than 15m and RestrictedAreas
for all other ships. Within the restricted
area,
anchoring, bottom trawling, dredging or any other underwater
operation
should be prohibited as
a minimum;
• Continuous surveillance of the dump areas advised
is to verify whether ships
are in compliance with regulations.
Overview of risk resuits
The risk assessment including the mitigating
measures is given in Table i for the
three route structures.
The residual risks are comparable for the present and
proposed route structure and largely identified
as ‘low” and very low”. The risk for
ships carrying explosives
is identified as “moderate”. In contrast, the risks
are
classified up to the high” level for the alternative
route structure.
It is concluded that with the implementation aforementioned
of the mitigating
measures,
the risks for the present and proposed route structures are (presumably)
acceptable. Attention is indicated to guarantee
that ships with explosive cargo stay
away from
the dump areas. Note that the recommended measures are
a
consolidation and extension of the “restricted
areas” that are presently already
indicated
above the munition dump sites on the nautical charts.
