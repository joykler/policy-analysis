- on the east side from the harbour entrance: the area between the North
the breakwaters to
Sea Locks IJmuiden inciuding
adjacent harbours;
North
• the Sea Canal with adjacent harbours to the buoys liii and on the fairway ‘het Ii’
1i12
in Amsterdam.
At sea the management
area of CNB is divided in two VTS area’s:
- Ijmuiden Port Control, VHF-61, working the
area: 5’ from harbour entrance to westside of
ocks;
- IJmuiden Traffic
Centre, VHF-07, working area; from 5 nm Out to (official) l2nm out.
The
radar range of the VTS radar is about 25nm, therefore
it is doubtfull that small vessels on the
edge of the radar range are detected.
The VHF range (VHF-61 and VHF-07) is about the same
distance
as the radar range. On the VTS Centre is also a VHF transmitter VHF-16 available with a
with
range >30
nm. In case of ‘near-miss’ situations the operators will
VTS use the distress channel and
divert the involved ships to the VTS channel
or use this channel to alert the ships on collision course.
The Vessel Traffic Service
frequent reports dangerous ‘near-miss’ situations, between traffic to- and
from IJmuiden with ships in the recommended routes
between TSS Maas North and TSS 0ff Texel, in
particular between
lm and 23 km 43 of the li-geul.
