Shallow
water effects on nuinoeuvrability
When a ship is moving in
shallow water, the restriction of water flowing between
the huil and
the seabed creates
a venturi effect that increases the difference
between the high pressure at the
ends
of the huli and the low pressure amidships.
Water is sucked down into the midships flow
region below the huli, so the mean
water level around the huil is depressed, which resuits
in a
significant reduction of
the under keel clearance that is known as ‘squat’. increases
Squat with the
following factors:
1) Squat effects increase
roughly with the square of flow velocity past
the ship.
2) Squat effects increase with the
ship’s draft to still water depth ratio.
3) Squat effects
increase with the ship’s block coefficient.
4) Squat effects increase with
the proximity of obstacles such shoals and
as passing ships.

A vessel passing a nearby shoal can
