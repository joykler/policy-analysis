This chapter presents the
baseHnes following from the FSA 2010, that served points of
as
departure for the current FSA (paragraph
2,1) The resulting varlants and situations that are
actually considered
in this FSA study report are presented
in paragraph 2.2.
2.1
Outline and resuits of the previous
Navigational Review: FSA2O1O
The 2010 Navigatlonal Risk af
Review Wind Park development In Dutch waters 259-7051
(Ref HZ
01,
lSth October 2010, “FSA2O1O”) considered six
(6) Variants as follows:
• Variant 2A
• Variant 3A
• Variant 4A
•
Variant 5A
• Variant 6A
• Wadden Noord
The study concluded that
the Variants 3A & 6A have the iowest risk-score in terms of navigational
risk.
These two varlants therefore form the basis for
the currentiy proposed IMO Variant,
The Dutch Administration and stakehoiders
the involved in the Consultative Committee on Water
and the
North Sea (Overlegorgaan Water
en Noordzee) conciuded that the design of a traffic
separation
scheme and an anchorage area near IJmuiden
are no regret measures In reiation to all
developed variants for potentiai
wind areas off the Dutch coast. They also conciuded that
the traffic
situatlon around the Horizon platform, where
many different traffic fiows converge, can be
improved
by separating and diverting traffic fiows. The paragraphs
below address the various
factors that iead to these conclusions
in more detail.
Near misses
In 2009 the Port of Amsterdam
conducted a survey about the safety situation cm roads to
the
Ijmuiden.
This research revealed some
undesirable safety situations that need improvement.
Especially
the vessel traf’fic services of Ijmuiden mentions near
frequent misses. These near misses
occur in the approach area
of IJmuiden, particuiarly between km 23 and km 43 of IJ-channei.
the
In that area a number of traffic fiows cross
each other in a north-south direction to and from Maas
North TSS
with traffic to and from Ijmuiden.
More tankers
The study also
showeci that the number of shlps on the routes of
Ijmuiden which need to anchor,
has grown. This trend has continued
after the economic crIsis. ThIs is due to the substantiai
increase in storage, blending and handling in
of gasoline the port of Amsterdam and the
commissioning
of the Vopak terminal in 2011, Because the availabie anchoring
area is regularly
full, ships move to other places
at sea. This often creates dangerous situations because
sometimes
ships
are anchoring neer traffic routes, where
they are not expected.
Undesirable situation Horizon
at Platform
The FSA2O1O conciuded that the number of
traffic Ilows around the Horizon Platform increases
risks to the platform.
Neer the platform traffic flows In varlous directions are
crossing and passing
eech other. That makes the situation
traffic complex and Is of high risk. The operator of the
piatform confirms this. He noted that the Is
safety zone lncreasingly violated. This is an undesirabie
situation.
Condusion
Therefore, FSA2O1O
the conciuded that the lmplementation of a new traffic
separation schema in
the approaches to Ijn,uiden and en additlonai
anchor area could improve safety. This is the case,
especially because
the shipping is better reguiated. It would also necessitate
shifting Maas North
TSS to the West rerouting
and traffic from Texel to Schouwenbank.
