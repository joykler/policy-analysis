in order
to ensure that all changes are inciuded,
the caiculation has been performed for
a very large area, see Figure
6-1. However, the largest part of the change occurs in a
much smaller “influence area”
off the Dutch West coast. It makes more sense to present
the changes
as percentages of the absolute values for the influence area, Therefore
firstly
a rough estimate has been made
of the contribution of the influence area in the
total value for the area of Figure
6-1. About 20% of all collisions will take place in the
infiuence area, which
is indicated by the 20% in the column for collisions.
The influence area
for collisions with ships in the anchorage set
areas is to 100%,
because only the anchorage areas for
the Western Scheidt and the Dutch ports are
inciuded in the calculations.
Applying the estimated percentages for the influence areas,
Table 6-4 contains the
changes in percentages in safety and economics in the influence
area.
For example this means for the proposed
route structure that:
• a
ramming collision with a ship at anchor decreases with 17%;
•
the change in collision risk for platforms fluctuates over the platforms. The risk
decreases substantially for some platforms, iricreases substantially
but for other
platforms. in total, the
decrease is 3,4% for a drifting collision and the decrease
is 5,9%
for a ramming collision;
• the risk of collision
with another moving ship increases by 3,2%;
• the foundering,
hulI failures and fire/explosion and also the costs change roughly
by the number
of shipping miles of 1,9%;
