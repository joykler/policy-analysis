11.3 Guidance on the Impact of Wind Parks
MGN 371 developers
requires of offshore renewable energy installations, or ‘OREI’s’ to carry out
a survey of all the marine activity that occurs within and close by the proposed options for siting
such installations and lists the factors that the must be taken into when
account choosing the final
sites. The notice inciudes the below
template shown as guidance for assessing the risk to vessels
using shipping that
lanes pass by wind parks.
