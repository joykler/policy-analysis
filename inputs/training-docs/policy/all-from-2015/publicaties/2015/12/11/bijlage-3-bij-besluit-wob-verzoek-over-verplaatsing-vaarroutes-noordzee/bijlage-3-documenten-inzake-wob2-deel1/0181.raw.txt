7. Conciusions and Decision Making Recommendatlons (Step 5)
The Forma! Safety Assessment has been carried out as an iterative process and Risk Mitigating
Measures that were Identifled durlng process readily
the became part of the gradual decision
making process to arrlve at the IMO Variant. Where possible, routeing optirnatisations that
design
followed from the FSA process, have been Iritegrated In the final version of the IMO Variant
routeing structure proposal,
The benefits derived from Implementatlon of the IMO Variant in terms of safety of life at sea and
improving navigation In both the
the area is dear from FSA/HAZID and QRA processes and Is
certainly an Improvement on the present situatlon, provided that all proposed Risk Control
measures (in
chapter 4) are implemented as a package-deal,
A number of additional RCOs for the reduction of residual risk have discussed and corisidered,
Including Emergency Towlng Vessels and upgrading the existing VTS stations. The Netherlands
government Is In the process of the capacity,
revlewing ETV almlrig at retalning the current ETV
capacity, be It possibly In a different manner by using multi-purpose vessels. Upgrade of VTS Is
also considered and Is part of international discussions en possibilities to extend VTS beyond l2nm.
Both RCOs can contribute more Is
to additlonal safety en a local and individual shipsâ€™ level than
assessed In the FSA, however both RCOs are considered as part of ongoing Dutch policy making
and societal
cost-benefit deliberatlons.
The balance of cost-benefit analysis of the proposed routelng structure Is considered positive by
shipping
the sector, as lncreased safety and Increaslng distances between TSS and wind farm sites
outwelgh the additional distances and costs Incurred by the proposed routeing measures.
