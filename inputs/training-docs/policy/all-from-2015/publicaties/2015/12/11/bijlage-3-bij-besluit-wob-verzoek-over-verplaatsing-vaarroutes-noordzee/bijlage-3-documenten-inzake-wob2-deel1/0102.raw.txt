NAV 58/14
Annex 5, page 2
5 In considering the proposed
changes to paragraph 3.12 of annex 8, the
Sub-Committee concurred
with the proposed text in message 14 for MOB and EPJRB-AIS.
6
At this stage, the Sub-Committee had no
further comments on the other proposed
amendments.
7 Additionally,
the Sub-Committee discussed the application of diver
AlS to location
devices and was
of the view that frequencies AlS 1 and
AlS 2 should only be used when a
diver was
in a non-routine situation.
It was considered that in these cases the device was
similar to a MOB device and that
the parameter and appropriate message for MOB should
apply. The Sub-Committee
was of the view that these devices should the
not operate on
frequencies
AlS 1 and AlS 2 for routine diver locating.
8 Noting that the
draft revision would be further developed, the Sub-Committee
requests WP 5B
to Iiaise the updated version of Recommendation ITU-R M.1371-4 for
consideration
by the Sub-Committee at its next session, to be in September
held 2013.
