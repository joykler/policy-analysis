Besides the storages, munitions from the German coastal Atlantikwall defence
were dumped. These storages contained
land mines, several electrical torpedoes,
and anti-aircraft
anti-tank ammunition and 10.5, 15, 24 and 28 cm naval artillery
sheils [Ruis, 2011].
The records in the Van Waning collection (see
Appendix D) show that small arms
ammunition (SAA),
propellants and pyrotechnics were recommended for destruction
by burning. Furthermore, these records
also include Appendix A and B of the
Standing Orders for Sea Dumping of the 304 EADCU, dated 20 December 1945,
which state that the following munitions were considered
dumpable:
• Grenades
• Pantzerfausts (when boxed)
• Mortars
• Rockets
firing
• Quick fixed (i.e. fixed ammunition, where the shell is attached to the
cartridge case)
• Quick firing separates (projectile, loaded separately to the cartridge case
containing the propellant)
• Bombs
• Igniters, fuzes, primers
• Chemical
weapons (CW)
In addition,
the following munitions were not considered dumpable:
• Small arms ammunition
• Mines
• V-weapons
• Quick firing separated cartridges (holding the propellant charge)
• Derriolition explosives
•
Bulk High Explosives (HE)
• Games and detonators
• Pyrotechnics
and bulk propellant
Available regulations and instructions, mainly from 1946, evidently focus on
safety.
Records in the Van Waning collection describe example
for that unboxed nose
fuzed quick firing separate sheils are only dumped if the fuzes have been removed.
Bombs could only be dumped when
marked “safe to move”. Dumping of munition in
the unsafe position is accordingly unlikely but cannot be ruled out. The Van Waning
collection presents additional safety measures
regarding dumping from Hopper
barges. When such vessels were employed, dumping was not allowed for: fuzed
projectiles of any type unless in their original
package, Pantzerfausts,
Pantzerwurfmine
and unrotated projectiles such as mortars (i.e. a safety
without
and arming device based rotation
on upon firing).
Despite
the safety regulations accidents did occur. The following reference was
found in [UK National Archives]
stating “a German ship, loaded with ammunition
and manned by Germans, blew up and sank without survivors in the North Sea
[sic]
141h
ammunition dumping area on the
[of August 1945]”. A cross-check with the
however
NIMH learned that this accident actually happened at Kattegat instead
of
the North Sea.
