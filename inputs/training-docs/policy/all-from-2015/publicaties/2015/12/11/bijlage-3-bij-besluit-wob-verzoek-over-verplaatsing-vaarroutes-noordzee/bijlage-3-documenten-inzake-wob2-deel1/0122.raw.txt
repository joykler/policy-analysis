ANNEX
PERFORMANCE
STANDARDS FOR ELECTRONIC INCLINOMETERS
1 SCOPE
1.1 Etectronic
inclinometers are intended to support the decision-making process 0fl
board in order to avoid dangerous situations as well as assist in and facilitate Maritime
Casualty lnvestigation by providing information about roll angle of the
the period and the heel
ship.
1.2
Electronic inclinometers should in a reliable form:
- determine the actual
heel angle with the required accuracy;
- determine the roll amplitude with the requtred accuracy;
- determine the roll period
with the required accuracy;
- present the information on a bridge display; and
- standardized
provide a interface to instantaneaus heel angte to the VDR.
2 APPLICATION OF THESE STANDARDS
2.1 These performance standards
should apply to all Electronlc inclinometers intended
to support the decision-making
process on board in order to avoid dangerous situations as
well
as to assist in Maritime Casualty lnvestigation, if carried, on all ships
2.2 In addition to general
the requirements set out in resolution A.694(17) and the
presentation
requirements set out in resolution MSC.191(79), Electronic inclinometers should
meet the requirements of these standards and follow the relevant guidelines on ergonomic
principles adopted by the Organization.
3 DEFINITIONS
3.1 For
the purpose of these performance standards:
Rolling motion around the longitudinal ship
axis of the
Actual heel angle momentary angle of roll referenced to a levelled ship to port or
starboard side
Roll period time between two successive values angle ori
maximum of heel
the same
side of the ship
Roll
amplitude maximum values of heel angle to part or starboard side

These perfomiance
standards do not appy to Electronic incllnometers installed for purposes which are
outside the scope of these guideilnes, e.g. monitoring of cargo status.

equipment and layout (MSC/Circ,982).
