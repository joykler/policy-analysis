Rule 3 - Definitions
Rule 3 defines terms used in the regulations,
inciuding the different categories that
a vessel can
be considered belonging to with
respect to the regulations. The feature
that determines which
category vessel
a belongs to is the extent to which the
vessel’s ability to take immediate action
to avoid collision
is restricted by what it is at the
doing time. So, for example, ships engaged in
towing have limited manoeuvrability
due to their tow, which might also seen
be as a separate
vessel unless they are displaying
the Iights and daylight shapes prescribed
in the regulations.
The other categories
• Power driven
vessel — Any vessel propelled machinery
by (i.e. its speed can be altered and
it can be steered in any direction).
• Sailing vessel
— A vessel under sail that is not also using
any auxiliary engine (i.e. it can
only be steered
in the directions that the wind allows).
• Vessel engaged in fishing — Any
vessel activelyfishing with nets, trawis, lines
or any other
gear that restricts its
manoeuvrability but not vessels fishing with
troli lines, as these do not
limit manoeuvrability.
• Seaplane — Any aircraft that is designed
to manoeuvre on the water, so this inciudes
flying
boats as well as what are
normally termed as seaplanes.
• Vessel not under command
— A vessel that for exceptional reasons
is unable to manoeuvre,
such as in the
case of an engine breakdown or ajammed rudder.
• Vessel restricted in her ability
to manoeuvre — Any vessel engaged in
vork that restricts
manoeuvrability. such
as dredging, underwater surveying, pipe
or cable laying. launching
or recovering
aircraft, replenishing another at
ship sea, mme clearance etc.
• Vessel constrained by her draught
— A power driven vessel restricted in its manoeuvrability
by the depth ofwater.andwidth
of navigable channel, relative to
the vessel’s draught and
size.
The regulations prescribe the Iights and
daylight shapes that the different categories
of vessel
must show and they
how must respond to each other in the various
collision risk situations.
Note
that afishing vessel movingfroin one fishing
ground to another, or a sailing boat under
engine power as well as sail are all
fust power driven vessels as as the regulations are
concerned.
