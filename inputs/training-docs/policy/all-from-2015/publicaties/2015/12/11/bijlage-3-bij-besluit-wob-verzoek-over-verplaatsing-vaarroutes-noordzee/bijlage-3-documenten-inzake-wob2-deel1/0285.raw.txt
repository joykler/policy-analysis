Report No. 25648-1-MSCN-rev.2 40
This traffic situation near the wreck Vinca Gorthon is far from ideal. An attempt to
salvage the wreck has been carried out attempt was not
in 2011. However, this
the
successful, Therefore proposed route structure is now designed in such a way that
all traffic will pass on the west side of the wreck. The traffic situation is illustrated in
Figure 8-2 by the black lines, being the borders of the proposed route structure. Also the
tracks of the route-bound traffic during 14 to 16 January plotted. These are
2011 are
extracted from AlS and therefore represent the traffic flows in the present situation.
Figure 8-2 shows that all ships that sail near the borders of the traffic lanes in the
proposed route structure will pass the wreck at a distance that is hardly larger than for
the current traffic
flows. In the present situation, however, the traffic passes on both
sides at a distance of at least 0,5 nautical miles.

The probability of a collision with the wreck is determined for the present traffic database
presented in Figure 8-3 and the traffic structure
flows for the proposed route in Figure
8-4.
