2.4 Offshore wind parks
The existing farms, OWEZ and PAWP have proved successful which has laid a foundation
firm
for the encouragement for further exploration which is evidenced wind
in the 12 licensed parks
under consideration.
An area for concern which manifests itself in both
Wind Parks and Oil and Gas Platforms is the
Security Breaches
which need to be addressed as soon as possible as the study has concluded
that unauthorized / unsupervised visits are a serious hazard. There are presently two offshore
wind parks in the Netherlands, namely:
1. Princess
Amalia Wind Park (PAWP), shown as ‘32’ on the FSA maps and formerly known
as ‘Q7’ and
2. Egmond (OWEZ),
aan Zee shown as ‘33’ on the FSA maps and formerly known as Near
Shore Wind Park (NSW).
2.4.1 OWEZ
The Egmond aan Zee wind OWEZ,
park, was the first big wind park to be built in the North Sea
off the Dutch coast and operating since 2006. The wind park is a project of Nuon and Shell. The
OWEZ wind park is situated some 10 to 1 8 km off the Dutch coast in the of Egmond
vicinity
aan Zee, in water depths of 17 to 21 metres. The farm
consists of 36 Vestas V90 wind turbines
having a total capacity of 108 MW. The total
area of the farm is approximately 27km
Operations
management
Operations management
is buik on a foundation of management of health, safety, security and
the environment — abbreviated HSSE. All activities related to the performance of the wind park
asset, the electrical infrastructure and substation, as well rnonitoring
as all surveying and
activities are carried structured fashion.
out in a HSSE is a core line management responsibility,
built on a policy
that is shared between all parties working on the project.
Man hour
recording and Incident Reporting
The total number spent
of man hours at the project site in 2009 was over 70,000 hours (over
60,000
in 2007 and 2008). Helped by the joint efforts from all staff working on the project,
including contractors, subcontractors, and owner representatives, again no injuries incidents
or
needed to be reported. NoordZeeWind (NZW)
stimulates and tracks the safety reporting to learn
and to improve.
Excellent reporting was done in 2009, resulting in over 200 reports.
