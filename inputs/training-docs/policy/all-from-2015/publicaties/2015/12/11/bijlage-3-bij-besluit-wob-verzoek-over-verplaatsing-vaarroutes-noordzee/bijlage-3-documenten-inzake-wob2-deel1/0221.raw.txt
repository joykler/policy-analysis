density for piles of articles
t is known
that a amount was by LCTs
that were anchored
while they dumped the munition, which
that munition is dumped in piles
and
is not randomly
distributed throughout the dump site. The LCTs
were loaded with on
220 ton of ammunition. The
size of the pile is hard to
and
a large uncertainty.
Judging from the geometry of LCT on
a an chain of
80 m, the pile a most
of at 500 Figure 18), with boxes that
did not rapidly
sink distributed over a larger downstream
from the main pile.
