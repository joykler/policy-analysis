This value is negligible
to the dimensions of a munition, decreasing the likelihood
of
uncovering
and displacing munition articles. likelihood
The of water turbulence with
munition to interact with
munition is considered impossible.
The probabilities interaction
of with a munition are differentiated by colours
on a
relative scale
going from impossible (blue) at left
the to likely (red) at the right.
Colour coding is assigned per
decade in probability and a translation is made to
qualitative terms for likelihood in line with the
Fine & Kinney method.
