Risk.
3.5 Assessment of Inherent
In order
to assess the risk associated with hazard components, i.e., frequency and consequence
need to be determined. The frequency and consequence may be expressed quantatively using the
categories defined in Table.
High 5 Very likely to occur during activity.
Medium 4 Likely to occur during activity.
Low 3 May occur during activity
Remote 2 Unhikely to
occur in practice
Not Credible 1
Not expected to occur during activity.
