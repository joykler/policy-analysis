Starting

the following per ship type
ship size:
• The number of
collisions (ramming/drifting) is multiplied with the matching
probability
of a certain type.
• Multiplication
with the probability the pile/turbine will fail upon the ship. Since it
is uncertain the pile will fail the away

probability is to 1. Thus, the
