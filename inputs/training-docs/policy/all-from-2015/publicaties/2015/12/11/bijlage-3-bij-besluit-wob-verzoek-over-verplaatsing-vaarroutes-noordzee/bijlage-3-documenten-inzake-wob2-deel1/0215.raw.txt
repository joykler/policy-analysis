5 Exposure,
likelihood of interaction with munition and
likelihood
of munition reaction
The exposure
(or probability of occurrence of a specific scenario) discussed
is in
the first paragraph. The likelihood of interaction
with munition is assessed in the
second paragraph and is based on the actual situation at the
dump sites. The
likelihood of munition reaction (burn,
deflagration or detonation) is discussed in the
third paragraph.
The third paragraph will assess the likelihood of sympathetic
detonation in order to know
whether or not one can rule out the possibility of a
propagation
of reaction throughout (part of) the munition dump, and
will treat the
effect of mechanical deformation on
the initiation of a munition. The likelihooci of
ignition
and consequential munition reaction is discussed both for direct
a
mechanical contact, for example
due to a sinking ship or a dropped anchor, and an
indirect mechanical
contact through the propagation of vibration to sensitive
waves
components like fuzes.
5.1 Exposure
The exposure is based
on probability calculations at the dumping areas as
presented two
in documents by MARIN [MARIN, 2011 a,b]. In the document,
latter
an addendum to the quantitative
risk assessment, the probabilities are given for the
following
scenarios:
• The present route structure;
• The
proposed route structure in which the northbound lane Traffic
of the
Separation Scheme (TSS)
is moved eastwards, so that the dumping areas will
be located
in the separation zone;
• The alternative route
structure, thus with the dumping areas near Rotterdam
located in
the northbound lane of the TSS.
Table 2 and Table 3 present the probabilities various scenarios
of at the location of
dumping grounds with
respect to the present route structure, and for route-bound
ships fishing
and vessels with Automated Identification System (Als), respectively.
