5.2 The wind turbines
For
the calculation of the rammirig and drifting risk It is necessary to actually include
wind turbines instead of only wind farm
the area. For this reason, the wind farm areas
are fihled up with wind turbines.
Because It is very time consuming to develop the optimal
configuration wind
of turbines for each wind farm, a more pragmatic approach is
followed.
The approach, already explained and [1], contains following steps:
used in the
1. 5 MW wind turbines are placed close
on the whole North Sea according to a
of spheres
packing with a distance of 960m (8 times the rotor diameter of 120m);
2.
Only the wind turbines withiri the designated areas are collected;
3. Wind turbines closer than 500m to a cable removed;
are
4. Wind turbines along
the borders of the area within 500m of a cable are not
removed,
to avoid that ships will enter the wind farm, or better, are allowed to
enter;
5. It is assumed that the required lOOm distance
to pipeline will not be a real
restriction and this
requirement can be fulfilled in the final design.
Because the risk is strongly related to the number of wind alternatives cari only
turbines,
be compared when dealing
with the same number of turbines.
