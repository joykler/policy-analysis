Title: Netherlands ‘Nind
park Formal Safety Assessment

1. Introduction
This introductive
chapter serves to make the reader acquainted
witli the history, context,
motives,
objectives and methods of the Formal
Safety Assessrnent (FSA) and with the structure
of this report, in which the FSA
process is documented.
1.1 Context
The plan to increase the Netherland’s
wind power generating capacity by building several large
wind parks the coast
off between the Rook of Holland and Texel has implications
considerable
for shipping
in this busy area. ARCADIS(UK) and MARIN
were contracted to assess the impact
of these wind parks on shipping to determine whether
or not the present routing rneasures for
shipping in the area must
be modified to accommodate the wind parks.
The basis of the report is a previous
study conducted by Arcadis, commissioned by the Ministry,
entitled ‘Navigational
Risk Review of Wind Park Development in Dutch
Waters (Ref:259-705 1
12
HZOI) October
2010. Five different wind park schemes
(Variants) were considered and the
analysis identified the most favourable Variant.
This favoured Variant was subjected to further
consideration and a hybrid
Variant was produced namely IMO Variant 1 6.09.11.
The IMO Variant was subjected
to a HAZID assessment at a workshop held in Rotterdam
on
20
September 2011.
After several iterations of the routing design this resulted
in the final IMO
Variant
12.12.11. This Variant was subjected to further
Hazid Analysis with notable
improvement
in comparison to the intermediate
draft IMO variants. Hazids were also applied to
the Present situation and Variant
1- 2010 of the initial study.
1.2 Proposal
28
At a meeting held at the
Port of Rotterdam offices on Thursday, July 2011, attended
bv
Captain Ben Van Scherpenzeel
for the Port of Rotterdam, Capt Fred Ministry
Bloot for the of
Water, Captain Jaques Van Kooten for RWS and Captain
Thomas J Proctor for Arcadis (UK) a
request was tabled by the Port of Rotterdam
to tender a proposal for the provision of a
qualitative FSA, including
HAZID assessment of a new ‘Variant IMO’ Wind park.
The proposal incorporating all requirements
of the scope of work was submitted on the
02
September 2011
and accepted on the 05 September 2011 by Captain Ben
Van Scherpenzeel.
1.3 Scopeofwork
The following text
lays out the scope of vork for this project and records
subsequent dialogue,
instruction between dient. Port of Rotterdam and Arcadis
(UK) to date to ensure deliverables
will meet the following requirements:
(Terms of reference
Formal Safety Assessment, Capt Ben Van Scherpenzeel
04.08.11)
1. The new “Variant IMO” should
be compared with the following Variants:
a. Present situation with wind park Q10 marked
as a construction area for wind parks.
b. Variant No.1
of the FSA2O1O (all so-called 2’’ round Wind parks implemented).
2. The HAZID/FSA includes
calculation of the extra nautical miles to be sailed
to the Port
of Rotterdam
and Port of Antwerp due to the changed lay-out
of the shipping lanes.
3. Part of the
HAZID/FSA will be a discussion about navigation marks
(amongst other
things the number and location of additional navigation
buoys)
4. Part
of the HAZID/FSA will be to discuss which routes should
be recommended routes
or Traffic Separation Schemes (TSS)
