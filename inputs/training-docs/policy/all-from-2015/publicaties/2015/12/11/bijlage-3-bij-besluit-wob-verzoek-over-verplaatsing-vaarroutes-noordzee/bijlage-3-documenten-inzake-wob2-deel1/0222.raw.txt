Figure 18 Estimate of area of a 220 ton gross
pile of munition dumped from a LCT anchored with
a 80 m chajn. vessel
The is estimated to swing ±10’ due to wind and current shifts.
The amount of HE of 220
in a pile ton gross is approximately 14,700 kg. Combined
with the size of 500 m2 this gives on average 29.3 kg HE/m or 39 HE-filled articles
per 2m see Table a density
8. Such is only achievable when articles Iie on top of
each other. A consequence is the high probability of a sympathetic detonation
throughout the
pile when only a single munition article detonates in an incident (see
paragraph 5.3.1). An amount of 10,000 kg, or two-thirds of the total amount of HE
in
one pile detonating order
in high is assumed for the effect calculations in chapter 6.
With this large munition
density it is impossible to arrange all munitions in one plane
side by side. The height of the pile is however difficult to estimate. The pile will have
slumped somewhat the
over years due to the sand being washed away beneath the
edges and decay of boxes. 1f for example a height of 1 m is adopted, the average
distance between centres of
the HE-filled articles is 294 mm.

probabiity
In order to estimate the probability in direct mechanical
the contact scenarios that
one or more munitions from the pile are hit by e.g. a dropped anchor, the density

should be expressed in /m instead of in /m An amount
