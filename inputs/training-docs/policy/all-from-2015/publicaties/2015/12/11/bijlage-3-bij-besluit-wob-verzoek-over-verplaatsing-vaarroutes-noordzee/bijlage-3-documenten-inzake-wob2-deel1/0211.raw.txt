This implies that the munition articles will only become uncovered
t the sand
transport conditions radically,
change when a fast sand transport would take place,
faster than the articles can be covered by the tidal action.
The sonar plots in Figure 11 and Figure 12 demonstrate
that only a tiny fraction of
the munition is uncovered. likely
It is that the sonar contacts represent munition
items
that are lying in the troughs where the sediment cover is thinnest.
The sonar
contacts appear to lie straight
in mes oriented perpendicular to the tidal current,
which seems to corroborate this hypothesis.

Figure 13 Bottom morphology
[Noordzeeatlas].
Figure
15 demonstrates that the munition dump sites have soft seabeds.
The dump
site off Ijmuiden is
marked with fSbkSh (fine sand broken shells) and fS (fine sand)
on the nautical chart. The dump site off Hook of Holland
is marked with cS (coarse
sand). These soft
bottoms may allow for a single munition item to subside into the
seabed without being deformed when pressed downwards
by for instance a sinking
ship. This however occur
is unlikely to for a pile of munition.
