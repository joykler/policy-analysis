Casualty threshold, safe return to port and
safe areas
13.1 The
Sub-Committee recalled that MSC 87 had approved MSC.lICirc.1369 on the
Interim
Explanatory Notes for the assessment of passenger ship systems’ capabilities after
a fire or flooding casualty to provide additional for the uniform
guidance implementation of
SOLAS regulations H-1/8-1, 11-2/21 and 11-2/22.
13.2 The Sub-Committee noted that neither NAV 56 nor NAV 57 was able to comment on
the Interim Explanatory •Notes and 22 and
agreed that its input on Interpretation
Interpretation 27 in appendix 1
of MSC.1/Circ.1369 was now required.
13.3 Having considered document NAV 58/13 (IACS) proposing revisions to interpretation
Nos. 22 and 27 of appendix 1 to MSC.1/Circ.1369 (NAV 58/13, annex),
the Sub-Committee
agreeci the proposal the
subject to deletion of AlS and Daylight signalling lamp from the list of
equipment essential for navigation, as set out in annex 13 and invited the Committee to
approve It and issue an addendum to MSC.1/Circ.1369.
13.4 The observer IACS
from thanked the Sub-Committee for its input and reminded
Members of
the implications of their decisions.
Progress on standards development
by the IEC
13.5 The Sub-Committee considered document NAV 58/13/1 (IEC) providing an update
on the progress made in the developmentlrevision 61996-1,
of varlous standards, ie. IEC
IEC 61924-2 and IEC 62388.
13.6 The Sub-Committee noted that, in the course of revising IEC 62388, a conflict had
been highlighted between the requirements of resolution and the of
MSC.192(79) availability
modern flat
panel displays. Resolution MSC.192(79) had a requirement for a minimum
display area of 195 x 195 mm, 270 x 270 mm and 340 x 340 mm for three cases, which was
not always consistent with the design and availability of modern displays embecided
when in
standard bridge consoles. Such displays the
employed a different aspect ratio than
parameter resolution
considered when MSC.192(79) was developed. Unlike resolution
MSC.192(79), resolution MSC.191(79) does not specify additional requirements for the
display area. Resolution MSC.191(79) specifically states, case conflict,
in of a the
performance standards take priority over presentation
requirements of the individual
performance
standards adopted by the Organization. IEC, therefore, intended to follow this
resolution and only inciude the requirements for the diameter of the operational display area
in the revision to IEC 62388.
Information regarding ice navigation training project
13.7 The Sub-Committee noted with appreciation the information provided in document
NAV 58/INF.16 (The
Nautical Institute) on their intention to develop international standards
navigation
for ice jointly with other industry partners.
13.8 In this context, the Sub-Committee recalled that 2010
the STCW Conference had
adopted in
Guidance regarding training of masters and officers for ships operating polar
waters and the corresponding resolution 11 recommending that governments adopt
measures conducive to ensuring that masters and officers of ships which operate in polar
waters have appropriate training experience. Furthermore, Organization
and the was
developing a mandatory
Polar Code for safety of life at sea and protection of the marine
