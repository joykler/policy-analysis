The zig-zag tests
These tests are conducted
to measure a vessel’s yaw checking ability directional
and stability. In
100/100
the zig-zag
test, the helm is put at port 10 and held
until the ship deviates offcourse
to port 100
at which point the helm is reversed to starboard
10 until the heading is to starboard of
its initial course when the rudder is
put back to port 1 0. The cycle is repeated several times and
the and overshoot angles
beyond the initial heading are measured. 20°/20°
The zig-zag test
applies an initial
20° rudder angle, which is reversed when ship’s
the heading alters by 20° to
measure
the overshoot angle.
