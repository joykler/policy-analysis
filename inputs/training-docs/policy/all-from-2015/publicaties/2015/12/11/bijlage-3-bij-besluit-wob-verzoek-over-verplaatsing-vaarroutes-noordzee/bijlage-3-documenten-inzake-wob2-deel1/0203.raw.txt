As munition was supposed to sink within three munition
seconds, the weight of
boxes was increased and
packaging was perforated. Special care was taken with
munition containing phosphor. Due to a phosphor munition incident on 28
related
July 1946 these types of
munition were to be blown at or near the site of detection.
As a result, dumping of phosphorous munition has likely
stopped or significantly
decreased after August
1946.
Furthermore, Unexploded
Ordnance (UXO) and munition with the fuze still present
were not allowed to be transported unless special precautionary measures were
taken. The Van Waning
collection for example reveals that base-fused quick firing
separate shells not in crates, were to be reported before being
to the Directorate
offered for dumping, which suggests
that fuzed munitions have been dumped. An
underwater camera image of an article considered to be a quick firing separate, is
given in Figure 4.

According to a former commander and amateur historian of the EOD, aircraft
bombs have been dumped in the North
Sea [Rozenbeek]. The dumping of aircraft
bombs is corroborated by Figure 5 [image 0738D obtained Foundation
from the
Historical Archive EOD], with
caption “dumping of a 3000 kg bomb from an LCT in
deep sea water”. The addition of “deep sea water” however, typically refers to water
depths of hundreds or a few
thousand meters, which suggests that this bomb has
not been dumped at the dumping areas off Ijmuiden and Hook of Holland.
