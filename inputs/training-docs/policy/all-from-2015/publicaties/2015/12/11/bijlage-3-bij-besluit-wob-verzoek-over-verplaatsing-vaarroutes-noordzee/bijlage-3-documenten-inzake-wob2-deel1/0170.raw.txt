13 Comparison of FSA/HAZID Risk scores
IMO variant 12.12.11 has a signlfcantly lower level of risk than either of the other two systems,
Taking all
factors into consideration, the dlfference between the risk scores for the present
situation and the Variant 1 option Is almost certainly within the FSA processes’ timits of error and
should
not be given any real significance.
3.2.4 FSA/HAZID Conciusions on risk assessment
The FSA/HAZID concludes
that the benefits derived from implementation of the IMO Variant in
terms of safety of life at sea improving navigation the area dear from
and in is the FSA/HAZID
process and is certainly an lmprovement on the present situation.
Implicit in the selection of IMO Variant was the utillzation of majority listed Risk Control
the
Options. The remaining RCOs are directed at reducing residual risk after implementation of the IMO
Variant and can be summarised as follows:
- appilcation the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972
of
(COLREGS);
- risk aware design, construction and operation of licensed wind farms;
review
- a of ETV capacity; and
- a review of the extend of VTS control areas.
3.3 QRA: quantltatlve risk assessmerit
3.3.1. QRA Methodology
The impacts for shipping have been wlth SAMSON model that has been developed,
quantified the
extended, validated and improved continuously durlng the last 25 years in studies performed for
the Dutch Maritime Safety Authority, European projects and commercial projects, A more extenslve
descrlptlon of the model is given Apperidix
in 2.
With SAMSON, MARIN uses ship movement databases to slmulate ships moving between selected
way polnts (ends of traffic
separatlon schemes, pilot stations, arichorages etc.) at a very much
accelerated rate 50 that, 1f the ships are started at a random times over the period being assessed
and
they are moving at a scaled up range of real speeds, then the programme can count up the
number of close quarters encounters that could be expected to occur over the period being
assessed. The programme than assesses the frequency of a collision occurring at each of these
