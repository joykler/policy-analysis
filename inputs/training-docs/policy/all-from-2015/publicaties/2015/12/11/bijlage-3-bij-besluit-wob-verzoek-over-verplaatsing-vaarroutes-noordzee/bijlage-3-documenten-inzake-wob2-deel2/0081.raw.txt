6.2.4 Input for costs calculations: fuel prices and consumption
This paragraph provides an overview of the fuel prices used in subsequent calculations.
Heavy Fuel 011 (HFO-38OCST)
Most ocean going vessels today use Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) in all engine and boilers, except the
generator engines. Fuel most often used is known as HFO 380 which bas a viscosity of 380
CentiStokes at 50°C. This fuel must be heated to reduce its before being burned in
viscosity
engines or
boilers. Suiphur content of this fuel can be as high as 6%, but will be limited to 4.5%
after May 2005 by international treaty. The average suiphur content of HFO in use today is
about 2.6%. International regulations require a flash point (closed cup) of over 140°F (60°C).
Marine Diesel Oil (MDO)
Marine Diesel OiI (MDO) is very similar to Marine Gas Oil, but has slightly higher viscosity -
typically 1 to 2 CentiStrokes at 50°C. This fuel does not require heating to reduce its viscosity
before being burned in engines or boilers. MDO can be used in diesel engines and boilers
without modifications.
Price developments of both fuels are shown in Table 18; fuel consumption of various vessels is
shown in Table 19. The consequent fuel costs / miie for various ships are shown in Table 20.
