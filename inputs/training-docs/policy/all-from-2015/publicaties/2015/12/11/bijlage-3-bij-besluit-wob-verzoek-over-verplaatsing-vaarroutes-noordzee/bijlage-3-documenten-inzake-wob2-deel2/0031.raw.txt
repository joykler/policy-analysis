Safety Assessment
ARCADIS
5. Part of the HAZID/FSA will be to at
least address, but not be restricted to, the following
issues:
Exploration
a. of small oil/gas fields
(changed since 2088).
b. Exploration
of Wind parks (changed since 2008).
c. Increased tanker traffic Port of
Amsterdam (changed since 2008).
d. Small
Aspects of crossing traffic (in present situation).
e. Issues found in previous
report (in present situation).
f.
Near misses with oil and gas platforms (in
present situation).
Risks concerning
g. the two ammunition dumping grounds
(in present and proposed
situations).
6. All draft reports will
be shared with stakeholders for
comments.
1.4 Objectives
Both ARCADIS and
(UK) Marin were asked to compare levels
the risk for the following three
different
situations:
(i) The present
situation with Wind Park ‘Q1O’ under
construction about twelve miles off
the coast south of IJmuiden with
the existing traffic routeing (separation and
schemes
precautionary areas) remaining
the same.
(ii) The ‘Variant 1’ (2010) situation
with all of the ‘Round 2’ wind parks
developed and
with the present
traffic separation schernes, associated precautionary
areas and inshore
traffic
zones remaining unchanged but connected
by recommended routes.
(iii) The ‘IMO
Variant’ (12.12.11) with all Round 2 Wind
Parks except Scheveningen WP
and with the traffic routeing amended to
increase the distance between the shipping lanes
and the wind parks.
Arcadis (UK) uses expert judgement and
qualitative methods to arrive at this comparison
of risk
levels.
1.5 Methodology
The HAZID method uses
a team based approach which incorporates
a structured brainstorming
technique in a
workshop setting, used to draw out information
from the participants. The team is
made
up of appropriately qualified persons. The
aim is to identify hazards capable of leading to
undesirable consequences as well
as the current and recommended control measures
for each
hazard. The hazards are
further assessed in terms of the associated
consequences and frequency
of occurrence.
The HAZID is carried out under supervision
of experts with both strong nautical
and
methodological experience, in the present
case two experts from Arcadis (UK).
Apart from leading the
workshop, the supervisors have carried
out interviews with the relevant
experts, industries
and organisations, in the run op to
the workshop as well as after the workshop
to clarify outstanding points and complement
the workshop results. As part of this
broader
inventory, the supervisors have
undertaken action to identify relevant
marine activities other
than shipping itself,
that form external influences to the HAZID
process.
The HAZID also uses the Formal Safety
Assessment process, illustrated in Figure
1. This is a
structured and systematic methodology
based on risk analysis and cost
benefit assessment (if
applicable). There
are five basic steps within this process:
