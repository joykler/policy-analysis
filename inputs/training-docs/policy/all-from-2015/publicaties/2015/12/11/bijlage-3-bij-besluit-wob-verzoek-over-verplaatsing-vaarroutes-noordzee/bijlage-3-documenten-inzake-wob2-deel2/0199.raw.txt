Directional Stabilily
Directional stability is the ability of a ship settie
to on a new steady heading in calm seas with the
rudder amidships after being
knocked off course by a transient force. There is no inherent
imbalance
of forces to return the ship to its original heading, though a wave crest
if striking the
bow obliquely yaws the ship off its set heading. then the
wave will tend to yaw a directionally
stable ship back again as it passes along
the vessel’s length. To understand directional stability
further, it is necessary to
examine how a ship is steered by the action of the rudder.

The propeller directs flow asymmetricelly around the rudder to force to
produce a port on the
stem, swinging the bow to starboard.
The resultant of propeller thrust and the rudder farce is
deflected to port of the centreline.
The vessel Is following a circular track
As the vessel drifts bodily out to port and the bow swings to starboard, 170w begins to divide

The huil now moves through the water
making a drift angle ‘cl’ to the streamîines. Low pressure
is created on to starboard
due to the accelerated flow whllst high pressure is produced to port.
A centripetal force acts to starboerd of the vessel’s c of g. so the ship follows en arc
of a circle.
