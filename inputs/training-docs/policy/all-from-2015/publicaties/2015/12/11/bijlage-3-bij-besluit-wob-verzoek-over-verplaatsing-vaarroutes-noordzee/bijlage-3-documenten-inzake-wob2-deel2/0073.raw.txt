Cost Benefit Analysis (Step 4)
Much of the Risk
Control Options (RCOs) listed above will have little additional
0fl fl0 cost
implication but
their improved utilisation and implementation
will certainly impact on the safety
aspect of navigation throughout the selected Variant.
The RCOs which need to be considered in
the FSA in more depth will
be analysed below.
6.1 Emergency Towing Vessels (ETVs)
6.1.1 Benefits
The function of ETV
capacity is to prevent that any maritime incident should
escalate into one of
catastrophic consequences for human, economic, finaricial
or environmental values, due to the
casualty vessel drifting. Early response to
an incident is more likely to contain the situation and
negate the historically large
associated clean up and compensation costs.
6.1.2 Situation in the Netherlands
The
Netherlands currently operate one ETV, is
which moored in Den Helder. In 2010 the “levoli
Black” has continued the ETV
task of”De Waker”. As soon as a report of a drifter is received
by
the Netherlands
Coastguard and assistance is required, the ETV is alarmed directed
and to the
drifter. probability
The of a ship needing assistance is higher severe
during weather conditions
when the drifting will also be larger. Consequently,
the Coastguard ETV maintains its station at
sea during wind conditions Beaufort
of 5 or more to minirnise its response times.
6.1.3 Market development
Although we might expect fail
a in charter costs due to the present decline shipping
in the
market,
the dernand and hence charter rates for tugs, which most
ETVs are drawn from, is
currently
rising and does not appear to be reaching
any plateau. Lead tirnes for new build can be
as high a two or three years and
the present second hand market is buoyant, with sellers
dernanding a prernium
for good tonnage.
It needs to be said that the
present growth rate in cost is related directly to the supply tugs
of that
ETVs are eventually
drawn from. Requirements for ETV’s compete
with a demand for high
horse power tugs due to the expansion of the offshore
industry / wind park developers into
deeper and in sorne cases difficult waters.
The expansion of the offshore industry may also pose
an opportunity for the ETV
market, as future multi-purpose of the tugs of this industry may
be
an alternative
means of providing emergency towing services.
In 2010. the UK
Government announced as part of the Department for Transport’s share
of cuts
in the Cornprehensive Spending Review, that the ETV fleet
would no longer funded by the MCA
from September 2011 claiming that ship
salvage should be a commercial matter between the
ship’s owner and the salvor.
The British Government (MCA)
have only recently in September 2011 terminated the use
of two
of the four ETVs,
presently in use around the UK coast. It was announced
that the two ETVs
operating
in the Minch (Stornoway) and the Shetland Islands
(Lerwick) be retained for a period
of 6 months and that the remaining two ETVs,
based in the Orkneys and the Minches are up for
review in March 2012.
