10 RISK
REDUCING MEASURES
The caîculations
are performed without any risk reducing measures. The risk reducing
measure that would have the most impact is the involvement of an emergency towing
vessel (EflI). In 2010 the levoli Black has continued ETV ‘De Waker’. As
the task of
soon as a report
of a drifter is received by the Netherlands Coastguard and assistance is
required,
the ETV is alarmed and directed to the drifter. The probability to get a failure is
higher during severe weather conditions and also the drifting speed will be larger. For
this reason, The ETV of the
Coastguard is positioned at sea during wind conditions from
5 Beaufort,
resulting in lower response times.
An ETV in the vicinity of a concentration of wind farms can reduce the probability of a
drifting contact considerably, namely with more than 50%.
