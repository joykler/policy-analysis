In [Wallace,
1994] it is conciuded that ignitions and
explosions are observed for
munitions that previously
had undergone and successfully passed conventional
drop tests
(ie. at flat surfaces), and that in some cases
modest drop heights
produce a very violent response.
Empirical relationships for the likelihood of
initiation
are developed according to [Wallace,
1994]. One example for the
likelihood of initiation of a
Mkl 1 depth charge is shown in Figure 26, showing drop
height and
drop weight combinations. No further data on spigot
intrusion tests with
all-up-round munitions are found
in open literature.
An important finding is that those spigots that punch
out a piece of the casing of the
munition are found to be the cause
of ignition. Another important finding is that no
empirical
relationships are established for the violence
of the response.

Figure 26 Drop
height and drop weight needed to obtain reaction in
spigot intrusion in Mkl 1
depth charge [Wallace, 1994]
Spigot intrusion
into cylindrical samples of high explosive has been performed
using
a 2500 kg drop weight and a 13 or 35 mm diameter
spigot [Cartwright et al., 2007].
The target assembly
with spigot and confined explosive, and drop weight
the
arrangement are shown in Figure 27 and Figure
28 respectively. Steel mass
catchers are in
place to limit the pinch to 1 mm and to prevent the target assembly
to be crushed. The test results, which include
Composition B and TNT, are copied
from [Cartwright
et al., 2007] in Table 17. In these experiments Composition
B is
shown to be more sensitive to this
intrusive impact scenario than TNT. Also a
deflagration/detonation
type of response is noted for Composition B in
case the
impact weight of 2500 kg weight drives
a 35 mm spigot into the sample at a drop
weight velocity low
as as 4.43 m/s.
