Conciusion and outlook
The safety
performance at PAWP continues to be good. Before
the last Lost Time Incident (LTI)
in 2011 there was a continuous 3 years without
any LTIs.
2.4.3 New Initiatives.
Besides the
existing wind parks mentioned above, there have many
been new initiatives for
offshore wind parks resulting in subsidy and permit
application. By the end of 2009, a total of 12
building permits for a total of 3250
MW were granted to initiators. The parties which acquired
a
permit were enabled to submit
a bid for production subsidy.
