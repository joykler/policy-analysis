Variant routes (North South accent)
Figure 19 again demonstrates that most proposed route structures increase the travel distances
for the common East-West oriented routes, as foliows:
- The extra distance for the proposed Schouwenbank to IJmuiden route (bright red) is: 7 mis
- The extra distance for the proposed IJmuiden to Schouwenbank route (dark red) is: 12 mis
- The extra distance for the proposed Maas Centre to IJmuiden route (light blue) is: 7.5 mis
- The extra distance for the proposed IJmuiden to Maas Pilot route (dark blue) is: 9.5 mis
IJmuiden route (dark green) 1.5 mIs
- The extra distance for the proposed Sunk East to is:
- The extra distance for the alternative Sunk East to IJmuiden route (light green) is: 1.5 mis
- The extra distance for the proposed IJmuiden to the Sunk East route (black) is: 1.5 mis
- The extra distance for the proposed Schouwenbank to Maas Pilot route (purple) is: 1.0 ml
- The extra distance for the proposed Maas Centre to Schouwenbank route (grey) is: 2.5 mis
