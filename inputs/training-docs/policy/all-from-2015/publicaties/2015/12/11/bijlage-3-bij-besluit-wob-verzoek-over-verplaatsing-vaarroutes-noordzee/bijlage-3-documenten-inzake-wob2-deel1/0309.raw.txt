Effect of a wind farm
The construction of a wind have
farm will some consequences for the shipping near the
location
of the wind farm. In Article 60 of UNCLOS is formulated that the coastal State
may, where riecessary, establish reasonable safety zones around artificial
islands,
installations and structures with maximum of 500m. safety
a By applying this zone of
500m around wind
a turbine, the wind farm is an area to be avoided. For so far as
known all States apply this safety zone of 500m for route-bound traffic, which means
that it is prohibited for merchant to sail through wind Therefore,
ships a farm. it is
possible that ships may have
to change their sailing routes in the future and pass the
wind farm minimum
at a of 500 m (equal to the safety zone around an offshore
platform). This means that the wind farm will cause a nuisance to the passing ships. The
policy with respect to small ships varies per country.
Some countries allow smaller ships
to sail through or fish within the area of
the wind farm.
The rerouting of ships can also have some effects outside the the wind
location of farm.
Because ships are forced to saN a different route
the traffic density will increase on the
other traffic routes outside the wind farm. Because
of the increase in the traffic intensity
