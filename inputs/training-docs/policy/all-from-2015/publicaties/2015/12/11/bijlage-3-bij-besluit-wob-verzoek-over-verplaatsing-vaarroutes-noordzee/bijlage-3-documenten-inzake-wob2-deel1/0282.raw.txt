Figure 7-2 Traffic database for proposed
route structure including links to and from
the anchorage areas
For the
calculation of the risk for each of the four anchorage areas proposed
for the
route structure It is assumed that all
movements to an anchorage area have that
anchorage area as destination are
(and not just passing through the area as a short
cut). For the ramming risk
It is assumed that the density of ships anchor same
at is the
for all anchorage
areas.
The calculated risk the
for present anchorage area and for the four new anchorage
areas for the route
proposed structure is given in Table 7-1. The last column “weighed”
is determined by assuming that the number of movements
to each of the four anchorage
areas s lirtearly related to the number
of ships at anchor in that area.
