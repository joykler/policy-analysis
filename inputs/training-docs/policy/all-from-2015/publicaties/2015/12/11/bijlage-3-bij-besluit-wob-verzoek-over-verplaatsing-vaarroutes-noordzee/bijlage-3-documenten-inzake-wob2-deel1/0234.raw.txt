flyer plate is by a Iayer of explosive.

Typical explosive and empty
case weights mortar and artillery munitions are shown
in Table 15. The ratio of explosive weight to empty always
case weight is less than
1, fulfilling one condition munition
for a to be robust, see Table 13. The average
fragment weight of medium and large calibre sheils is 12-15 and gr
5-30
respectively, according [Fisher
to & Peugeot, 2002]. Recalculating the fragment
mass to dimensions of steel cubes gives a typical thickness .25 cm.
of 0.86-1
This is near and above the other
one of criteria for a munition to be robust. The
munitions of interest in this study are therefore considered to
be robust, i.e. the
threshold criteria of Sensitivity
Group 1 in Table 14 apply.
Demolition charges are an example of munitions Sensitivity Group
in 5 and they are
more sensitive than the
robust munitions. They can also easily be dumped in large
quantities. Even though they ignite more readily upon deformation compared
to
artillery and mortar sheils,
the reaction of such a thin case munition is probably
limited to the burning reaction, see Table 12, which hazard
poses no real to a ship.
