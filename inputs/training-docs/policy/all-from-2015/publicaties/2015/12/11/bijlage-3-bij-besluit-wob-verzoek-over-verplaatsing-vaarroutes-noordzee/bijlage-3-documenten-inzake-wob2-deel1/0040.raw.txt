in emergency situations and not as distress alert systems.

DEVELOPMENT OF AN E-NAVIGATION STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
6.1 The Sub-Committee recalled that:
NAV
.1 55, NAV 56 and NAV 57 respectively had established a working
group, including a correspondence group to werk intersessionally to
progress the issue. MSC 87 and
MSC 88 had noted the progress made to
date; and
.2 STW 42 and COMSAR 15 had also considered the reports of the
relevant
Correspondence established by
Group the NAV Sub-Cornmittee and
provided their
expert input to the development process of e-navigation.
6.2 The Sub-Committee noted that COMSAR 16 had endorsed final draft
the list of gaps
relevant to radiocommunications and search
and rescue (COMSAR 16/WP.5/Rev.1
annex 3) and instructed
the Secretariat to forward it to both STW 43, for further revision from
the training
perspective, and NAV 58, for final consideration.
6.3 The Sub-Committee noted that commented
further STW 43 had that:
.1 some training elements, especially those that were in general covered
by
the STCW Convention and Code, might need to be reviewed in the
future in
light of the developments
forthcoming on e-navigation; and
.2 the revision, updating or development of training elements should only be
considered in the future, after having a dear understanding
of the potential
technical, operational and regulatory e-navigation
solutions that would be
developed
by the Organization.
6.4 Accordingly, STW 43 had instructed the Secretariat issue revised version
to a of the
report of the Working
Group (STW43IWP.3!Rev.1), in order to allow the
Sub-Committee
NAV to refer to the revised draft list of gaps as agreed by STW.
Consequently, STW 43 had endorsed the final draft list of gaps relevant to training
(STW 43/WP.3/Rev.1, annex) and instructed the Secretariat to forward it to NAV 58, for
final
consideration.
6.5 The Sub-Committee noted that MSC 90, as requested by NAV 57, had approved:
.1 cu rrent
overarching e-riavigation architecture;
.2 proposed way forward for developing a Common Maritime Data Structure
(CMDS);
