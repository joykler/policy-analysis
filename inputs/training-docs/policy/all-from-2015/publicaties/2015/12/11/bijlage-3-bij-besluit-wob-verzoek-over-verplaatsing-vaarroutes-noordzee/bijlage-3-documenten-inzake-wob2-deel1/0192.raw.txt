It is seen that structure are comparable
the risks for the present and proposed route
and that the highest risk is qualified as “moderate”, which is identified for ships that
carry explosive risks up to the high”
cargo. The alternative route structure presents
level. The overall risk for the alternative route structure is accordingly higher than
for the present and proposed route structures.
As a reference, the risk levels without mitigating measures are presented in Table ii.
Tables iii and iv respectively display the underlying overall likelihoods for an
underwater explosion including and without mitigating measures. The effects in
case of an underwater explosion are displayed in Table v.
