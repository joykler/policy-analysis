The
following effects can be quantified with the SAMSON
the model:
• expected
number of accidents per year, divided over type
of accident, ship types
and sizes involved in the accidents
and objects;
•
extra miles that have to be travelled as a
result of a certain development and the
costs involved;
• emitted environmentally dangerous
goods, e.g. exhaust;
• consequences of the acciclents such
as the outflow of oh or personal injuries.
Effects that cannot quantified
be are improved aspect of vessels and dear in
intentions
encounter
situations.
For quantifying the risk, the model
requires the following input:
• description of geographical
the area;
• a traffic database describing traffic
all flows;
• current;
• wind rose data.
An offshore
wind farm introduces an additional type of risk, the risk
being that a wind
struck
turbine is by a ship. Two types of collision risk are distinguished,
namely:
ramming
• A contact takes place when a ship IS 0fl a
collision course with a wind
turbine and a navigational error occurs.
A navigational error can have various
causes, like lack of information,
not being able to see the wind farm, not being
present on
the bridge, getting unwell and not being able act, making
to an error
etc. A ramming contact will take place high
with speed: 90% of the service
speed ofa vessel.
• A drifting contact occurs when ship
a in the vicirtity of a wind turbine
experiences a failure
in the propulsion engine or in the steering equipment.
Since the ship
slowly becomes uncontrollable as it loses speed, combined
the
effect of wind, waves and current may carry the towards
ship the wind turbine. 1f
dropping an anchor does not help
or is not practical and the repair time exceeds
the available time,
the ship may collide against a turbine. This generally happens
at a low
speed.
The probability of a contact wind
with a turbine depends on where the traffic flows are
with respect to the wind farms.
In order to quantify this ramming and drifting risk the
offshore wind
farms have to be filled up with wind turbines actual
with an geographical
position.
The impact of the
offshore wind farms is quantified by comparing the risk case
of the
with wind farms
the with the risk of the base case without the farms.

Recently one has tried to salvage
the wreck of the Vinca Gorthon that is located in the
present traffic flow
from Maas North TSS to Texel TSS. Because this
was not
successful,
it was asked to pay special attention the risk posed
to by this wreck. Also a
wreck
in the proposed new anchorage area for
deep draught vessels needs special
attention. These aspects are described in
Chapter 8.
