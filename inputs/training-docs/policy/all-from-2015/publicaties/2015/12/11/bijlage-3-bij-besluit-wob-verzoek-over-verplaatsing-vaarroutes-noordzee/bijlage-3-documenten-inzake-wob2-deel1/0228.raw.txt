Figure 20 shows the reduced energy
flux density in a shock wave versus the
reduced distance for the detonation of HBX-1 explosive charges
at 14 meter water
depth at a mud seabed and hard
a seabed respectively [Swisdak, 1978].
pressure
The data were recorded at or near the bottom. This
situation is
representative for the
sympathetic detonation scenario where also shock wave
propagation
near the North Sea seabed/water interface is analysed.
From Figure 20
it is conciuded that the influence of
a muddy or a hard seabed has a negligible
influence
with respect to the sympathetic detonation
scenario studied.

Shock sensitivity of high explosives
A typical value for the maximum shock sensitivity will be about
1 GPa. This value is
taken from the current {AOP-7], where
it is listed as one of the requirements for a
booster
explosive. Booster explosives are allowed to be in-line with
main charge
explosives like TNT and
Composition 6.
