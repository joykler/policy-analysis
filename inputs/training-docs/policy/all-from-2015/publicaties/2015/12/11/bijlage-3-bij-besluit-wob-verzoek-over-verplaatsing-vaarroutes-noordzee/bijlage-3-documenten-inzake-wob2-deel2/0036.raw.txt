Table 1. Overview of near misses in the approaches
to Ijmuiden in 2009
Three of the near misses occurred where a north or south bound ship was crossing a vessel in the
deep-water channel, so there may have been confusion
over rule 9 of the ‘Colregs’.
1. MOL Endowment-Santos Star:
The container ship ‘MOL Endowment’ is
heading for the TSS 0ff Texel, the out
bound container ship ‘Santos Star’ left the
IJ-geul 0ff buoy IJ-9. According ColRegs
rule 15, (crossing situations) the ‘MOL
Endowment’ should change course to
vessels agreed
starboard. However, both
on VHF-16 for the ‘MOL Endowment’ to
cross very close ahead the ‘Santos Star’,
due to the crowded situation in the anchor
area (see figure
2)
2. Niledutch Singapore-Cosco Europe:
The container ship ‘Niledutch Singapore’ is
following the IJ-geul buoys to IJmuiden.
The container ship Europe’ is
‘Cosco
heading for TSS 0ff Texel. ‘Niledutch
Singapore’ probably assumes she must
keep speed and
heading. Both ships
agreed an avoidance manoeuvre by VHF,
which failed or was misunderstood. At the
alters
last minute the ‘Cosco Europe’
course hard to starboard and shortly after
the ‘Niledutch Singapore’alters course
hard to port.
