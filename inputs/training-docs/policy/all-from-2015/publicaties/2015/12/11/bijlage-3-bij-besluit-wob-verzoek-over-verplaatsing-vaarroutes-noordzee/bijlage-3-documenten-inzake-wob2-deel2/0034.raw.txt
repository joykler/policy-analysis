- on the west side from the harbour
entrance: a circular area with a radius of 12 nm that
inciudes deep
the draft channel IJ-geul and Deep Water Anchorage;
- on the east side from the harbour entrance:
the area from the breakwaters to the North
Sea Locks IJmuiden
inciuding adjacent harbours;
- the North Sea Canal
with its adjacent harbours to the buoys Iii 1 and 1J12 on the fairway
het
IJ’ in Amsterdam.
The following figures and tables
illustrate several near-miss reports on the IJmuiden Approaches
(see overview Figure
in 2). The Centraal Nautisch Beheer informed the Rijkswaterstaat
North
Sea department
about the insufficient anchorage capacity and the dangerous
situations arising
between ships to or from Ijmuiden and ships
in the recommended routes between TSS Maas
Noord and TSS 0ff Texel.

2. Overview of the approaches to Ijmuiden
At
sea the management area of CNB is divided into the following two VTS areas:
- IJmuiden Port Control, VHF-61, working area: entrance
5’ from harbour to west side of
the locks;
- IJmuiden Traffic Centre, VHF-07,
working area: from 5 nm out to (official) l2nm out.
The radar range the VTS
of radar is about 25nm, therefore it is doubtfull that small vessels on
radar
the edge of the range are detected. The VHF range (VHF-61 and VHF-07)
is about the
same distance as the radar range. On the VTS Centre is also a VHF
transmitter with VHF-16
>30
available with a range nm. In ‘near-miss’ situations
case of the VTS operators will use the
distress channel and divert
the involved ships to the VTS channel or use this channel to alert the
ships course.
