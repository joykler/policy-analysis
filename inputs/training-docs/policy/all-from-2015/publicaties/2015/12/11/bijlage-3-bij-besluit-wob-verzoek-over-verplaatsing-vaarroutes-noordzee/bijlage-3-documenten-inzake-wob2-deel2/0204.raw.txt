Putting a ship’s engines
to a setting that is significantly lower than the vessel’s
actual speed is a
more effective way of reducing its speed than going full
astern at the earliest moment that the
rnachinery allows because flow is over
maintained the propeller but directed onto the back of the
blades rather their face,
than so the ship’s ahead motion is driving the propeller rather than the
other way around.
How effective the procedure is depends on the machinery’s
ability to absorb
the energy delivered by the propeller shaft, diesel
engines being much better at this than steam
turbines. Keeping water flowing
over the rudder also maintains steering control.

Reducing the rpm increases the taken
time per revolution and so also increases the advance.
Tuming the propeller astem whilst the ship is still
moving ahead al full speed creates an excessive
angle so the

the wdder is disrupted. Steenng
control is consequently lost

Reducing the to slow ahead when a ship is at full speed produces astem thrust
