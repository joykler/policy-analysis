Formal Safety Assessment
ARCADIS
7. Decision making recommendations (Step 5)
The benefits of implementing the IMO Variant in terms of safety life at sea and
of improving
navigation in the area is dear from the FSA/Hazid process
and is certainly an improvement on
the present situation.
Implicit in the selection of IMO Variant was the
utilization of the majority listed Risk Control
Options (RCOs) (Step 3)
in Chapter 5. Details of the alignment of ships’ routeing measures
relative
to possible wind park developments and oil and gas platforms and supporting
rationale
are found in the relevant chapters on Risk Assessment (Step 2, chapter
4).
The remaining RCOs are directed at reducing residual risk after implementation
the of the IMO
Variant and can be summarised as follows:
- Application of the International
Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 (Colregs);
- Risk aware design, construction operation
and of licensed wind parks;
- A review ETV capacity;
of and
- A review
into extending the VTS control areas.
