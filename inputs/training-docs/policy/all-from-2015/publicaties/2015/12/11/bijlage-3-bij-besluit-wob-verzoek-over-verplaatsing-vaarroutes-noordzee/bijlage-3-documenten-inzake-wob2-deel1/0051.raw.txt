10.5 The Sub-Committee proposing
considered also document NAV 58/1011 (Japan)
amendments to practical
draft performance standards for electronic inclinometers to address
problems in measuring heel angle of ships in motion, and exploring options for possible
framework for the performance standards respect to how to with acceleration
with deal
forces.
10.6 The Sub-Committee considered further document NAV 58/10/2 (China) providing
comments and proposals on the draft performance standards for electronic inclinometers in
document NAV 57/WP.5, annex 2.
10.7 The delegation of the Netherlands was of the view that the revised draft
performance standard for electronic inclinometers, as developed by Germany, should be
used as the basic parametric
document and, in addition, sections 8.1 and 8.2 regarding
rolling and/or synchronous roll detection and heel angle warning should be retained.
In addition, several other delegations supported the proposals submitted by Japan and
China.
10.8
The ICS observer was of the opinion that the draft performance standard need not
include a warning of parametric rolling and/or synchronous roll detection, whUst the IACS
obsenier stated the issue of
that the draft performance standard should also address
emergency
power.
10.9 Accordingly, the Sub-Committee agreed to use the annex to document NAV 58/10
as the basic document for consideration Technical Working Group to finalize the
by the
performance Sub-Committee
standards for electronic inclinometers. In this context, the
referred documents NAV 58/10, NAV 58/10/1 and NAV 58/10/2 to the Technical Working
Group,
Establishing the Technical Working Group
10.10 Having also considered agenda items 5, 6 and the sub-items under agenda item 13
relating draft Code (DE 56IVVP.4, annexes and
to the for ships operating in polar waters 1 2)
and the draft MSC resolution on Recommendation for the protection of the AlS VHF data link
(COMSAR 16/17, annex 12), the Sub-Committee re-established the Technical Working
Group and instructed It to consider all relevant documents submitted under agenda
items 5, 10 and 13E and 13F and, taking into account any decisions of, and comments and

amendmenis to Recommendation
statement to WP 58 (agenda item 5);
.2 consider document NAV 58/5/2, annex 2, in particular the proposed
and the annex to the Draft
initiatives on applications using AlS technology
CPM text containing the VHF Data Exchange concept developed by IALA
together with the comments made in document NAV 58/6/7 on VHF Data
Exchange (VDE) and provide advice, as appropriate, as well as a liaison
