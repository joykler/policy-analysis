pick
up a substantial speed reduction (e.g. 15
knots to 10 knots) of a target reasonably quickly.
Rule 17 — Action of the stand on vessel
Whenever a risk of collision
exists, the stand on vessel shal! maintain
its course and speed until
it considers that
collision cannot be averted by the give way
vessel’s actions alone, at which
point
it can take action but shail, wherever possible,
not alter course to port. Although altering
course to port may seem an attractive
action for the stand on vessel in risk of colliding the
with
give vessel in a crossing
situation, ii’ is extremely dangerous close
at quarters because the give
vessel may suddenly
wake up to the risk and alter to
starboard, which will almost certainly
result
in it ramming the stand vessel side on.
1f the stand on vessel makes a large alteration to
starboard it will pass through moving
in the same direction as the give way
vessel and this
greatly increases time
the available to avert collision. This really
is the only option available to
the stand on
vessel and the action taken by most watch
keepers in this situation is turn hard to
starboard and continue the turn through a
full 360° if the non compliant give way vessel
takes
no action, in which case it will
have passed dear by the time the stand on
vessel resumes its
original track. Making
the a full 360° turn does require necessary
the sea room to be available
and dear
of other vessels and putting the helrri hard
over at full speed is a violent manoeuvre,
as it will greatly increase the bad
engine (thus sending exhaust temperatures sky high)
whilst
also heeling the vessel over to
an extent that depends on its stability
state. However, slowing
down is not an
option for the stand on vessel at this late
stage in events, as there is insufficient
time for
it to take effect and even if there
were, it could make the collision more likely to occur
if the give way vessel simultaneously alters
course to starboard.
