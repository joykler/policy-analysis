The objective of the system is to facilitate the exchange of information between
the ships and the shore in order to support safe navigation and protect the marine
environment. The system will
also contribute to providing information to relevant
SAR
authorities.

regulation Vu 1. 1f reports are not submitted
and the offending ship
can be positively identified, then information will be passed
on

accordance with national legislation. The mandatory ship reporting Barents
system SRS
is for the exeharige of information
only and does not provide any additional authority
for
mandating changes in the vessel’s operations. The reporting system will be
implemented consistent with UNCLOS, SOLAS and other relevant international
instruments so that the reporting system will not provide
the basis to impinge on a
transiting vessel’s passage through the
Reporting Area.
