Annex 9, page 4
9 PERFORMANCE TESTS, MALFUNCTIONS AND
INDICATIONS
9.1 Electronic inclinometers
should internally check and indicate to the user 1f all
components are
operative and 1f the information provided is valid or not.
MODULE C - INTERFACING AND INTEGRATION
10 CONNECTIONS
TO OTHER EQUIPMENT
10.1 Electronic inclinometers should comprise a
digital interface provicling actual heel
angle information to other
systems like e.g. the voyage data recorder (VDR) with an update
rate of at least
5 Hz. Electronic inclinometers should also comprise a digital interface
providing
the displayed information of roll period and roll amplitude (paragraph
7.1 refers).
10.2 Electronic inclinometers have a
should bidirectional interface to facilitate
communication, to transfer alerts
from inclinometers to external systems and to acknowledge
and
silence alerts from external systems.
10.3 The digital interface should compliant
be to the relevant international standards
11 INSTALLATION
POSITION
11 .1 The installation position
of the sensors of the electronic inclinometer should be
recorded and made
available for the configuration of the voyage data recorder.
12 POWER SUPPLY
12.1 Electronic
inclinometers should be powered from the ship’s main source of electrical
energy.
In addition, it should be possible to operate the Electronic inclinometers from
the
ship’s emergency source of electrical energy.
Refer to publication IEC 61162 — Maritime navigation
and radiocommunication equipment and systems —
