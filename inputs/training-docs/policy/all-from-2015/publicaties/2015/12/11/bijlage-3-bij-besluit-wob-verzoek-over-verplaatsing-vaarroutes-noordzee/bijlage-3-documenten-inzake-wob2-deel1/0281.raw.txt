7 MOVEMENTS TO
AND FROM ANCHORAGE AREAS OF IJMUIDEN
The present anchorage area
is replaced by four possible anchorage areas for the
proposed
route structure. In the calculations of Chapter It is assumed average
6 that the
number of ships will be spread over the four anchorage
areas in such a way that the
average number of ships per
square miie (the traffic density) is the same for all
anchorage
areas. However, no attention was paid to the routes to and from these
anchorage
areas while these change considerably. By incorporating
not this in Chapter
6, comparison of the resuits with the results for
traffic variants of [1] was made possible.
In thid chapter
the impact of the change in the movements to and from the anchorage
areas is quantified. For the present anchorage the
area movements to and from the
anchor areas are presented in Figure
7-1 together with the traffic database for the
present situation
including Q1O.

area
Figure 7-2
contains the traffic links to and from the four anchorage areas for
the
proposed route structure with the traffic database used in
Chapter 6. The figure contains
the names of the anchorage areas
that will be used in the tables. It shows that
anchorage area NE is difficult reach,
to because the lane with outgoing traffic has to be
crossed twice. This area is more convenient for ships from Ijmuiden that will anchor
for
some time waiting for orders. For these ships
the anchorage area will be located at the
right side.
The anchorage
area NW will not be used initially, but will come into use when there
is a
need to.
