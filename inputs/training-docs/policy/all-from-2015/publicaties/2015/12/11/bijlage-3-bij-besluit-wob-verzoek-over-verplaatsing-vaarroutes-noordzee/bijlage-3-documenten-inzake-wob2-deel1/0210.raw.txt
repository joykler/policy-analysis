3.3 Dimensions
There are two indications dimensions
of the of the dump sites:
extent
• the of sonar contacts ina survey of the dump sites [Ham etal., 2001];
• the charted location
of the dump sites on the nautical chart (WGS84 1NT1416
1630 and WGS84 1NT1418 1631).
Judged from the sonar plot, the dimensions of dump site IJmuiden equal:
(573000 -
= 10.106
570500) x (5825000 - 5821000)
= 2500 m x 4000 m m and the
dimensions
of clump site Hook of Holland equal: (557500 - 556000) x (5787000 -
= 3.106 13106
5785000) = 1500 m x 2000 m
m This results in a total area of m
= 10.8106
The dimensions on the chart are slightly larger: 3000 m x 3600 m
m for
= 5.6106
IJmuiden and 2500 m x 2250 m Hook
m for of Holland, resulting in a total
16.4.106
13.106
of m The smallervalue of m as derived from the sonar plots
is
adopted, both because t results in a higher
and therefore more conservative
munition density to be used for the risk assessment and because thought to
it is
represent the most accurate
measurement.
3.4 Bottom morphology
The munition dump sites are
in areas where the tidal currents create sand waves on
the
seabed as shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14. Sand waves come in various
sizes, from ripples to mega ripples,
sand waves, long bed waves to tidal sandbanks
[Koning, 2007]. The size of 0.1 to 5 m amplitude is referred to as sanci waves.
The
positions of sand wave crests and
troughs slowly change with time. The waves are
constantly migrating and move in a general northwards direction, rate of up
at a to
10 m per year.
The sand waves are caused by tidal currents, as a water flow to 1 m/s
of just 0.5
already picks up a sand
gram and deposits it downstream. The wavelength at the
munition
dump sites is typically in the order of a few hundred meters [Koning, 2007].
For example, according to [Angeren, 2011]
the wavelength at Hook of Holland
measures approximately 400 m with a crest height of 6 m. In between
these large
sand waves, smaller waves
occur with a height of 0.5 m and a wavelength of about
5 m.
Munition is made of explosives or is composed of metal and explosive. Propellant
cases, although unlikely been
to have dumped according to the recommendations
in the Van Waning collection (see Appendix D), are the only munition articles
that
may contain a significant amount of air.
1f not perforated during the dumping
activities the latter should have filled up with water as it is unlikely these cases
that
are still watertight after
70 years. Therefore the density of the munition items equals
at least the density of the explosive (approximately 1650 kg/m for but
TNT)
significantly more when cased with (with
steel a density of 7800 kg/m The density
of the explosive alone is approximately the same the density of water-saturated
as
sand, so there is no strong buoyancy
effect when buried in sand, not even for the
least dense munition.
Steel cased munition is too heavy
to be picked up by the water flow and thus
remains stationary. This means that the munition can only move downwards
when
sand underneath it is washed away.
Consequently, the munition tends to
concentrate at the lowest level of the sand waves, ie. in the and the
troughs,
majority of the munition items will be covered
by sand.
