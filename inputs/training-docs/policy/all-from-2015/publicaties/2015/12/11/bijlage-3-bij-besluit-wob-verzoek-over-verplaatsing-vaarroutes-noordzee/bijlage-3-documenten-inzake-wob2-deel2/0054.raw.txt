Risk for all categories
3.6 Risk Matrix
Each hazard will be identified and considered within the Risk Matrix these definitions
using for
frequency
and consequences. The risk matrix is then used for recording all the hazards and for
hazard with
‘scoring’ each a frequency and consequence in order to establish the risk value.
Let us look at workingfrom
a ladder.
The ‘Frequency’ of working from ladder is quite common
a and we must decide, in the
context of the task, what FRN (Frequency Ranking Number) assign
to to the task.
For example let us say 4.
The ‘Consequence’ of working from a ladder can be severe and we must dec ide, in the
context of the task, what CRN (Consequence Ranking Number) to assign to the task. A
fail from a ladder can result in at least ‘Serioi,s /moderate personal injury’ which gives
CRN 4.
of, say,
Hence, Frequency (4)
(4) x Consequence = Risk (16)
The combination of Frequency Consequence is following
X illustrated in the
Risk Matrix to predict the risk associated with each hazard.
