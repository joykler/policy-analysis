A
year at sea, while other estimates are between containers. To update
3000 and 4000
the probability per miie that a
container is lost, the estimate of 10000 lost per year is
used. This number
is related to the number of miles travelled by container vessels per
year. This number of miles is caiculated from the shipping characteristics database,
assuming an average speed of 80% of the forward speed,
a bad of 50% of the capacity,
and also assuming that ships
spend 70% of the time at sea. Further it is assumed that
larger are
ships more likely to bose a container than smaller container ships. A
relationship with the (TEU capacity)t1131 is used which means roughly the probability
that
is related to the length of the ship.
When using this rate for the NCS this results in 67
containers overboard in
the NCS per year. This number is verified with the number
reported
in pubbication [2), in which It was reported that 217 containers were lost from
2006-2009
in 11 incidents. This means on average year
54 containers per in 275
incidents per year, and therefore
on average 20 containers per incident. Thus the rate
per nm at which containers
fail corresponds to what is observed in the NCS. This rate
has been applied
to the ships that cross the dumping areas near Rotterdam.
The probability of deck cargo overboard nautical because data is
per miie is not updated
not available, but the probability
is much lower than for a container overboard.
Probability of anchoring
From the analysis of the AlS-data
of 2010, it can be conciuded that the dumping areas
are not used for anchoring,
as was to be expected, because there was no reason to do
that just
there. However, that might change for the proposed route structure because in
that situatbon the dumping areas of Rotterdam ships
will be crossed by all north going
that use the rnoved Maas North TSS.
Normally,
ships will not anchor in a traffic iane. Only in case emergency such as
of an
an engine failure the ship may need to anchor. behaviour
The of shipping with respect to
anchoring when saiiing through
a traffic lane of a TSS is studied in [3). All anchoring
cases found the
in AlS data of 2008 and 2009 were analyzed. In some cases the
problems were reported to the Coastguard. Then in consuitation, anchoring
a suitable
bocation was assigned. In other cases
the anchoring location was determined by the
ship. The study has deiivered
the probability of anchoring per nautical miie when sailing
through
a traffic lane. Furthermore It gave insight in where the ship will anchor, within
the traffic lane, in the separation zone or just outside. In case the Coastguard
was
invoived, it was assumed that
the anchoring bocation was safe for 100%. In the other
cases It was assumed
that in 5% of these cases, the master did not, or wrongiy, consult
the nauticai chart before anchoring. Only in these 5% of the cases, it is possibie that the
ship will anchor in a dumping area case results of
(a of erroneous anchoring). The the
study are summarized in Table
9-2.
