Probability of incident per year
The
following notes relate to the specified incident scenarios.
Ship sinks
The exposure is derived from the probability of foundering and the probability of
sinking after collision.
The exposure inciudes the sinking of fishing vessels.
Ship anchors
The exposure equals the probability to anchor where the ship saus in the present
route structure.
The exposure is derived from the probabulities to anchoring in the
lane, in the separation zone and just outside the shipping lane of the TSS for both
the alternative and
the proposed route structure. The exposure inciudes the
anchoring of fishing vessels.
