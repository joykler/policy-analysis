(i) Uninterrupted differential GPS coverage is normally available in this area,
so masters of deep draught ships navigational systems
equipped with GPS
can be informed
continuously and highly accurately about the ship’s
deviation from and progress along the axis of the route.
(ii) Those ships which because of their draught are confined to the
rnid-channel zone are strongly advised above
to make use of the
equipment.
