Summary
The Dutch
Ministry of lnfrastructure and Environment (Rijkswaterstaat) has
advanced plans for adjustment of the current
traffic lanes for shipping on the North
Sea. On their request TNO has undertaken an assessment of the risks of ship
traffic
across or near the munition dump sites off IJmuiden
and Hook of Holland.
Scope of the risk assessment
The risk
assessment:
• Is performed for:
— The present route structure;
— The proposed route structure
in which the dumping areas off Hook of Holland
will be located in the separation zone of the Maas North Traffic
Separation
Scheme (TSS);
— The
alternative route structure with the dumping areas off Hook of Holland
located northbound lane
in the of the TSS:
• Is based on the following incident scenarios:
— ship sinks;
— ship anchors;
— drifter drags anchor;
— fishing baat drags bottom trawling gear;
— ship loses container or
other deck cargo;
— vibration of ship movement disturbs seabed;
— water turbulence due to propeller
wash disturbs seabed;
— ship strikes seabed with keel or propeller;
• Incorporates:
— fishing
boats,
— small category container
to largest ships;
— ships with polluting cargo (oil, chemicals);
— ships with explosive cargo (gasoline, LPG);
• Is limited by ships with a maximum draught of 15 m, which relates to the water
depths in the area.
Desk study and input
Since both the likelihood and effects of an underwater detonation depend on
the
amount and types of dumped munition
and the applied dumping methods, the latter
are of prime importance to the risk assessment. For this reason, a
comprehensive
search was performed the archives
of of the Netherlands Institute for Military
History
(NIMH), the Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit of the Ministry of Defence
(EODD), the Archives
National and several other sources. This survey shows that:
• 30,000 and 20,000 tons of munition have been dumped at IJmuiden and
Haak
of Holland respectively (conservative
estimate);
• The dump sites are likely to consist for the greater part of munition for fire
arms
of all calibres. Fuzed
munitions may be present. Aircraft bombs are unhikely to
have been dumped in large numbers. Mines, sea mines, depth charges and
torpedoes were dumped,
not or have been dumped in very small numbers.
Chemical weapons are very unlikely to have been dumped;
