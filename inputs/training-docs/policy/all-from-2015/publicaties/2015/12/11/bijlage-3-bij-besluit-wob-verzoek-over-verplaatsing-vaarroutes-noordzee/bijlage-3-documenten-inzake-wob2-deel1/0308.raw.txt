A QUANTITATIVE RISK ASSESSMENT WITH SAMSON
This
appendix describes the generic approach quantitative with
for the risk assessment
SAMSON,
SAMSON
The
has been developed to predict the effects of spatial developments
in the North Sea (or other sea areas). These developments
can vary from development
within the shipping industry
itself (e.g. changes in ship sizes) to measures for the
shipping (e.g. Traffic
Separation Schemes).
The following effects
can be deterrnined by the model:
• Expected
number of accidents per year, divided over type of accident, ship
types
and sizes involved in the accidents and
objects;
• Extra miles that have to be travelled as of a certain
a result development and the
costs involved;
• Emitted environmental dangerous goods,
e.g. exhaust;
• Consequences of the accidents such as the
outfiow of oil or personal injuries.
During the last
25 years the SAMSON model has been developed, extended, validated
and
improved continuously in studies performed for the Dutch Maritime Safety
Authority
and European projects. The system diagram SAMSON-model
of the is shown in Figure
A 1. Almost all blocks
presented in the diagram are available. The large block Maritime
traffic contains
system” four sub-blocks. These sub-blocks describe the complete
traffic
pattern: the number of ship movements, the characteristics
of the ships (length etc.) and
the layout of the sea area. different
The casualty models are used to determine the
accident frequencies
based on the complete traffic image. The block Impacts” contains
the sub-blocks that are used to determine the different consequences the
of different
accidents.
