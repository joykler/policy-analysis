5.32.2 Non-uniform mechanical
loading of a munition
The deformation and
pressure thresholds in Table 12 for inducing reactions
in thick
thin
and case munition have been applied impact
to the of large concrete debris on
munitions through 3-dimensional
numerical simulations [Malvar, 1996].
Two
examples of the simulation of an M107 155
mm’shell impacted by a 12 inch
diameter piece of concrete
are given in Figure 24. At the left side of the figure
is a
impact
the on a free standing 155 mm shell,
at the right side the impact on the
same shell stand ing against
a solid back wall. In the latter case the
deformation of
the high explosive fill is more severe. This situation
compares for example to the
impact of a ship’s keel on
a pile of crossed cylinders (munitions). Instead
of the
impact
of the concrete sphere the impact realized
is by the solid wall; but the
transfer of impulse
to the impacted shell, thus its deformation, will
be of the same
order.
The summary of the
numerical simulations in terms of deformation and
pressure are
copied
in Table 16. A prediction of the reaction violence
is given, based on the
thresholds in Table 12.
At impact velocities below 800 ftls the presence
of a back
wall makes a significant contribution to the
crushing of the munition. A rough order
estimate of the impact impulse
required for sufficient deformation to cause
a low
order reaction
is kgm/s.
By comparison
of the 10 kgm/s threshold impulse in non-uniform
mechanical
loading with the 3.110 Pas threshold impulse
in uniform mechanical loading, see
Table 14, one can roughly
state that these loadings are comparable in
case of 31
load-bearing
points per square meter. For
large caliber munitions one may expect
that a uniformly applied
laad will be borne in less than 31 contact
points per square
meter
for a munition pile, which is a direct indication
that non-uniform mechanical
loading is worse compared
to uniform mechanical loading.
