1 DUMPING AREAS
Three
dumping areas for explosive material are locateci In the area with the proposed route
structure. These three areas can be found in Figure 1-1. The areas are filled in with dots, being
the positions of ship crossed area near
that have the area in 2010, The location of the dumping
IJmuiden will
be improved, because this area will come in an area cleared of shipping for the
proposed
route structure, see Figure 1-2. However, the two dumping areas near Rotterdam wiU
come into the north going traffic lane of the moved North TSS, see Figure Therefore,
Maas 0-1.
the probabilities
of incidents are quantifled that can lead to a dangerous situation due to the
explosive
material in the dumping area.

The AlS data of 2010 is used to acquaint insight ships cross the dumping areas and
in how many
search for ships that have anchored has
to in these areas. Each 2 minutes an observation been
performed. The positions of all ships with AlS are plotted in Figure 1-2 and Figure 0-1. These
contain many fictive AlS messages, made from radar observations. These radar observations are
not inciuded in the analysis. These echoes which small
belong to small unidentified ships, under
fishing ships not yet obliged to have an AlS transponder. The larger fishing vessels are inciuded
because they have an AlS transponder
