Figure 16 Sketch ofdifferentievels. For
reference, a typical bulk carrierwith a length of 175 m
and a draught of 8 m is drawn.
The sand pattern has a wave length of approximately
500 m.
4.2 Distance between keel and munition
The eight scenarios are divided into four distances vessel
between keel of the and
munition article:
• In the event of a sinking
ship or a ship striking the seabed with its keel or
propeller,
the distance between charge and vessel varies between 0 - 1 m;
• In case of objects dropped on
to the munition, eg. a presented anchor or a lost
container or other deck cargo, the estimated distance measures 8 m to several
tens of meters depending on the location,
tide, draught, speed and length of the
vessel. For example; for munition situated at a depth of 20 m the distance
measures about 50 m between a container
falling overboard at the rear end of
the ship and sinking at a rate of 4 m/s [Verhagen et al., 2011] while the ship
travels at 10 mis. However,
in case the container fails overboard at the front
end of the ship with a length of 50 m or more, this distance measures about 10
m as the container is still underneath
the ship at the moment it reaches the
seabed. For the calculations a conservative distance of 10 m is assumed;
• For water turbulence
(or currents) disturbing the seabed due to propeller wash
or vibrations in the water disturbing the seabed resulting from a passing ship,
the distance is conservatively
estimated at 5 m;
• When an anchor or bottom trawling gear is dragged through the munition dump
site (a normal anchoring manoeuvre, drifter,
fishing), the distance between keel
and munition is estimated at 100 m.
The distance categories versus incident
scenarios are summarized in Table 1.
Table 1 Distance between keel and munition versus incident scenario.

5 m Vibration of ship movement disturbs
seabed,
water turbulence due to propeller wash
disturbs seabed
10 m Ship anchors, ship loses
