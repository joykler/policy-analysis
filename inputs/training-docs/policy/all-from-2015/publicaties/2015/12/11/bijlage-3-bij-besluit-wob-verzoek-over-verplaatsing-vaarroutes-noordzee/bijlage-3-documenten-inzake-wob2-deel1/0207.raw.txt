With an
munition of approximately
220 ton, the six LCTs about 150 journeys

to the one off Hook of
Holland. Since the total

150 piles of dumped munition at
IJmuiden and 100 piles
at Hook of Holland. Since the munition articles

is a risk of
sympathetic detonation within
one pile (not between piles). The maximum credible
is on a detonation single
