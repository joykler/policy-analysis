east/west going traffic in the amended Maas Junction precautionary area is improved.
8. Maas Centre precautionary area: Vessels from Maas North TSS for the Maas Centre

9. West and Amalia Wind parks: The IMO
greater clearance between ships and the wind parks than variant 1. Clearance is still less
than a miie for the Breeveertien wind park but the park shadows a diverging junction, So
there is not a high risk of a potentially dangerous crossing encounter being obscured.
