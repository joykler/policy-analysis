3a SWxS going traffic pass to starboard a Risk of colliding with the buoy Damage and pollution due to 2 2 The swept depth over the
wreck marked by an east cardinal buoy a vessel colliding with the wreck is 23.5 m, which is
that is 1 mi inside the lane where it is 3 buoy
similar to the surrounding
mis wide depths, so the buoy may be a
greater threat than the wreck.
