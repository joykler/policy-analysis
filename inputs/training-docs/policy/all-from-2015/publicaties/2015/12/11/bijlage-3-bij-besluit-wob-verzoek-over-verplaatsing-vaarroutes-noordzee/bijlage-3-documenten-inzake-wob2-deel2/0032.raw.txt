Title:
Netherlands \Mnd park Formal Safety Assessment
ARCADIS
Identification
1. of hazards (a list of all relevant accident scenarios
with potential causes
and outcomes);
2. Assessment of risks (evaluation of risk
factors);
3. Risk control options (devising regulatory
measures to control and reduce the identified
risks);
4. Cost benefit assessrnent
(determining cost effectiveness of risk control measures); and
5. Recommendations
for decision-making (information about the hazards, their associated
and
risks the cost effectiveness of alternative risk control measures).

1.6 Report Structure
Chapter 2 of this report addresses External
the Hazard Influences, such as oil and gas platforms,
wind parks, traffic trends and
near-miss trends that have been considered in this HAZID study.
Chapters 3 of this report gives a detailed overview
of the HAZID methodology and approaches.
Chapter 4 (Step of
1 and 2 the FSA) presents the results of the HAZID study, both for Hazard
Identification
and the subsequent Risk Assessment.
Chapter 5 (Step 3 of the FSA)
Iists the Risk Control Options (measures to reduce the identified
risks). A distinction made
is between RCO’s that are integral in the proposed routeing structure
and
RCO’s that can reduce the residual risk in further implementation processes.
Chapter (Step 4 of FSA)
6 the outlines the Cost Benefit Analyses (cost effectiveness of the risk
control measures).
focussing on the cost of employing ETVs (Emergency Towing
Vessels) and
the additional distance incurred for commercial traffic.
Chapter (Step 5
7 of the FSA) gives the Decision Making Recommendations
