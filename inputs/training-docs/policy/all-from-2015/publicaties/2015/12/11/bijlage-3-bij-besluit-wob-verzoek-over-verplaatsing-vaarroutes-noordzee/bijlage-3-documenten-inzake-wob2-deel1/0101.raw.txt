RECOMMENDATION ITU-R
M.1371-4
Technical characteristics
for an automatic identification using
system
time-divislon
multiple access in the VHF maritime
moblle band

IMO would like to thank
ITU-R Wp 58 for the liaison statement contained
as in
annex 30 to document
5B)62, sent in June 2012, requesting IMO’s
Sub-Committee on
Safety of Navigation (NAV)
to consider the proposed
amendments to Recommendation
ITU-R
M.1371-4.
2
The NAV
Sub-Committee, at its fifty-eighth session
from 2 to 6 July 2012,
considered the
liaison statement and agreed to inform
ITU-R WP 5B as follows.
3 With regard to the
proposed changes in annex 1, paragraph
2.1.6 concerning
AIS-SART station, NAV
the Sub-Committee considered MOB
that and EPIRB-AIS devices
shoiild not
be subsets of Af S-SART. This
is because these devices do not conform with all
the requirements
and
characteristics of an AIS-SART, for instarice, battery life, etc.
It was
further noted that other devices
than AIS-SART are not considered be locating
to devices
under the GMDSS.
Therefore, the Sub-Cornmittee
suggests that paragraphs 2.1.6.1 and 2,1.6.2 should
be
renumbered as new headings
such as 2.1.7 Man overboard devices
(MOB) and 2.1.8.
Emergency position
indicating radio beacon — automatic identification
system (EPIRB-AIS).
The
Sub-Committee further suggests
that the description of these devices should not
refer to
an integrated AIS-SART
transmitter but to a device using burst transmissions as
described in
annex 9 of the Recommendation.
4 The Sub-Committee discussed
again the navigational status parameters
in annex 8,
table 46 (existing Table 45).
The
Sub-Committee concurred with the
proposal to revise the definitions of the navigational
status parameters 11 and 12 for regional
use as follows:
- Parameter 11 to “power-driven vessel
towing astern” and;
- Parameter 12 to “power-driven
vessel pushing ahead or towing alongside”.
In considering
the term “regional use”, the Sub-Committee
was of the uncierstanding that
visiting ships would not be required to use
these navigational status parameters and that
the
relevant national maritime Authority would
inform shipping about the use and interpretation
of
these parameters
when in use.
The Sub-Committee did not
concur with the proposal to define navigational
status
parameter 13 to “requiring assistance”
for regional use. This is because
distress alerting
using AlS has been
not yet developed and is under consideration
in reviewing the GMDSS.
The Sub-Committee concurred with the
proposed changes to the description of navigational
status parameters 14 and 15
to be extended to include MOB and EPIRB-AIS.
