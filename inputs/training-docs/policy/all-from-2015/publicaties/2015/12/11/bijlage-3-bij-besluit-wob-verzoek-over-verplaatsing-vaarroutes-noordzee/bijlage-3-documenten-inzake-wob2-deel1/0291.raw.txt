The probability of a contact wreck
with HY2166 has been determined in the same way
as for the Vinca Gorthon.
Table 8-2 contains the results of these calculations for the
wreck
HY2166.

structure
Only the last column of the table makes sense because the other
ships will sail just over
the wreck without hitting the wreck. Therefore, the
other values are crossed out. Also,
most ships
in the largest class will not have sufficient draft to hit the wreck.
When it is assumed that all ships above the wreck of
more than 100000GT will hit the
wreck, the probability of a contact
with the wreck will be 0,000095 per year, thus once in
10500 years
for the present traffic flow and once in 21500 years 110,000047) for
the
(
proposed route structure. The proposed route structure signiflcantly
therefore reduces
the probability of a contact.
This is not
according to expectation, because more routes with high iritensity are located
closer
to the wreck. Reasons for this unexpected reduction are:
• 70% of the probability of a contact in the present situation is caused by
traffic
fiows with low intensities. These traffic disappear
flows for the proposed route
structure because ships have
these to follow the proposed route structure.
• The dense traffic flows proposed
for the route structure are traffic lanes within a
certain form of
TSS, while the present traffic flows are sailing without a strict
lateral limitation. This means that the lateral distribution of present traffic
the
flows is wider than for the traffic flows the proposed
within route structure.
Therefore more ships
will pass the wreck on short distance even when the
centreline
of the traffic flow is further away.
Because the water depth above the wreck is nearly
always larger than is indicated in the
nautical chart with 21 .3m
to LAT, It is extremely unlikely that a ship will hit the wreck. An
analysis of the
AlS data of 2010 has been performed to get insight in the size
and
behaviour of the ships in the vicinity of the wreck.
