ARCADIS
When the ship’s rudder
is put over to starboard, it makes an angle
of attack with the water flow
and so
acts as foil to generate a sideways force port
to that swings the ships head to starboard
whilst the ship simultaneously moves bodily,
or ‘drfts’, out to port. The pressure increases the
on
port side whilst the huil develops
an angle of attack, known as the drift or
yaw angle’, with the
water flow. Asymmetrical
flow develops with the immersed
huilform acting as a vertical
hydrofoil
to reduce the pressure on the starboard side
and so create a pressure difference across
the huil sides, which produces centripetal
the force that makes the ship follow a curved track to
starboard. The curved track
becomes an arc of a circie when rate of
the yaw in degrees / second
equals
the angular rate at which the vessel moves
along the track.
The effective point through
which the hydrodynamic huli
force acts is invariably forward of
amidships because the boundary layer of disturbed
water increases in thickness towards the stem
and so reduces the etfectiveness the
of aft half of the hull acting as an hydrofoil. The
hydrodynamic buil
force consequently also creates a yawing moment
to reinforce that of the
rudder. far
How forward of amidships the hydrodynamic force
buil acts depends on the shape of
the underwater buil but, 1f It acts through
a point aft of the bow, known as the ‘neutral point’, then
its moment is sufficient to maintain
the yaw required to follow the circular for
track that particular
rudder angle and
the force on the rudder disappears. This condition
is known as neutral directional
stability
and the neutral point moves closer to the
bow as the rudder angie in increased. A ship is
directionally stable if the hydrodynamic
huil force acts aft of the neutral point but directionally
unstable if the huil force acts
forward of the neutral point.
