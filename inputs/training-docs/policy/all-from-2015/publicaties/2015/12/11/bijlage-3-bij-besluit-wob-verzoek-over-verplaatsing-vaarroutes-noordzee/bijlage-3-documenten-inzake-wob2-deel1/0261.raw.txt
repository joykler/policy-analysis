2 INTRODUCTION
The ambition of the Dutch
government is to realize offshore
wind farms with a total
installed
power of 6000 MW. The question “where
in the North Sea” is subject of many
discussions because of the opposite interests
of different stakeholders. Several studies
on different topics
already have been performed,
Last year, a Quantitative Risk Assessment
(QRA) has been performed for six variants,
each containing a number of
sub-variarits. The report “Quantitative Risk Assessment
for
Offshore Wind Farms the
in North Sea” of May 2010, reference contains
[1], the results
of all variants and
sub-variants at that time.
Since then, ongoing discussions
with all stakeholders have resulted in a proposal
for a
new route structure
on the Dutch part of the North Sea that is
based on concentrating
the
shipping in a network of routes. This network
of routes is developed in such a way
that all wind farms that were licensed in
round 2 (wind farms Beaufort, Breeveertien,
Browri Ridge East,
Den Helder, Q10, Q4, Tromp and West-Rijn)
can be built, with the
exception of
Scheveningen Buiten, because this
wind farm will come into the Maas
North TSS, that is moved to the west
for creating space close to the coast for other
activities.
objective
The of the new route structure is
the improvement of the safety around
offshore platforms in general and in particular
the Horizon platform, safer approach
to
IJmuiden, safer and larger
anchorage areas and finally safe locations
for the
development
of wind energy.
The topic of this report is
the impact of the proposed route structure on
safety of
shipping. Also
aspects such as costs of extra miles and emissions by
detours, are
quantified. Because it is expected that wind
farm Q10 will be built within short time, this
wind farm is considered to belong present
to the situation.
contains
The report the following chapters:
Chapter 3 gives the objective of the study.
Chapter 4 describes approach
the followed.
Chapter 5 describes
how the input for the calculations is determined.
Chapter contains
6 the resuits of the calculations.
Chapter 7 contains the risk assessment for
the anchorage areas of IJmuiden the
in
proposed route structure.
Chapter 8 deals with
the risk of two wrecks for which the proposed route
structure can
have
consequences.
Chapter 9 describes the risk of the dumping
areas in the new Maas North TSS.
Chapter 10 describes best
the risk reducing measure.
Chapter 11 contains
the coriclusions and recommendations.
The calculations have been
performed for the layout of the proposed route structure
of
September 16, 2011. The
changes on this design, near the Deep Water
anchorage area
of IJmuiden
are not made in the figures of this report.
