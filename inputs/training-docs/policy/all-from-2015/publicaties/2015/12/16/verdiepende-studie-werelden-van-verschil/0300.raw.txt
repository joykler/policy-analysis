tion is complete when members of groups are no longer judged as members of groups and
when there is no longer any discussion about the group as a fully embedded part of soci-
ety. Neither of these conditions has been met, especially in the Turkish-Dutch and Moroc-
can-Dutch groups. The yawning gap and stereotypical perceptions – on both sides – are
still much too great for this.
Notes
1 A note of caution is warranted with regard to the quantitative study. The available (quantitative) data
do not enable us to separate cause and effect (clearly) from each other. We were however able to
establish associations between a large number of variables. In the interpretation of the associations
found, we acknowledge that certain relationships may be bidirectional. At the same time, the power of
the analyses is that we were able to determine simultaneously how a large number of individual factors
relate to socio-cultural positions.
