natives and the emotional and cultural distance from Dutch society is limited. The category
‘assimilation’ also has limited social and emotional ties to the ethnic origin group.
The socio-cultural landscape in the Netherlands is thus diverse, with assimilation at one
extreme and segregation and ethnic isolation at the other. However, this does not mean
that all types can be placed on a single dimension of ‘distance’: different combinations of
positions on the emotional, cultural and social dimensions can be observed. There are also
hybrid socio-cultural positions, in which a focus on one’s own group is combined with a
focus on contacts with Dutch natives and Dutch society. There is therefore wide variation
and by no means always an accumulation of positions.
The emotional and cultural dimensions are closely interlinked. If the cultural distance is
high, so is the emotional distance in most cases. This is in line with earlier research show-
ing that the receptiveness to cultural influence is greater when there is a higher degree of
identification with the host society (Turner et al. 1987) and that cultural distance can be a
barrier to the formation of ties to the host society by migrants (e.g. Zagefka and Brown
2002). The social dimension is slightly separate: people can feel a bond with their own eth-
nic origin group but not have many contacts with them (‘ethnically isolated’ category), or
they may have frequent contacts with Dutch natives without either a strong emotional
bond and/or a wide cultural difference (‘moderate segregation’).
The picture per ethnic origin group
A fifth of migrants of Turkish origin belong to the category ‘segregation’, as do one in seven
(15%) of those of Moroccan origin. People of Surinamese and Antillean origin are much less
often found in this category: less than 5%. A relatively small proportion of migrants fall
into the category ‘ethnically isolated’.
