available to the people of Saba, as well as scientific DNA tests that would allow many to 
have some exploration of their African heritage that was stolen from them (if they so 
choose). 
6) Diversity 
Some attendees voiced the need for diversity training on Saba to help ease perceived racial 
tensions and help build a more integrated community on Saba. Several pointed to the still 
apparent segregated nature of Saban villages/communities. 
That the government should create specific policies that address the (perceived) racism on 
Saba. Some of this may be due to the view that decisions that impact different segments of 
the community should be more transparent as the actual case may be influenced by other 
biases like class and family, if at all. 
7) Reparative Justice 
That the above recommendations will go a long way to providing some form of reparative 
justice to the descendants of Sabaâ€™s enslaved population, but the Dutch government 
continue to engage with this discussion as it is only through continuing dialog will all 
Sabans be able to build a just, equal and harmonious society. 
That there be more dialog with the government, schools, the community, and even other 
islands in the Dutch Caribbean on issues of slavery, racism, discrimination, and reparative 
justice.
