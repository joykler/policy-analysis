Practices Similar to Slavery in 1956 which elaborated upon the 1926 laws through additional 
64
guidelines. Notably, Article 3 of the Supplementary Convention criminalised slave trafficking 
and Article 6 criminalised enslavement and selling individuals into slavery. This international 
agreement is still operative today and has 124 parties as of 2021, including the Netherlands 
which ratified the Convention in 1957. 
 
These historical conventions highlight the increasing international intolerance of and the 
65
movement of the international community towards the criminalisation of enslavement. 
Culminating in the Rome Statute (1998, entering into force in 2002), this instrument established 
the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague (the Netherlands) and provided for the 
66
ICC to have jurisdiction over war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. Most 
relevantly, Article 7 of the Rome Statute categorises acts that constitute a crime against 
humanity with the explicit addition of enslavement in 7 (1) (c). While enslavement is 
specifically mentioned, numerous acts categorised as crimes against humanity have also been 
67
committed by perpetrators of the slave trade. European individuals, including ones from the 
Netherlands, participating in the slave trade forcibly deported and transported African people 
to Western lands (that would have been considered these days in violation of 7 (1) (d) of the 
Rome Statute), forcibly imprisoned Africans on the coasts of Africa and severely deprived them 
68
of their physical liberty (in violation of 7 (1) (e) of the Rome Statute). Moreover, it can be 
argued that slavery and the slave trade constituted persecution against an identifiable group on 
racial and ethnic grounds (violation of 7 (1) (h)) as 17th century Europeans no longer deemed 
it morally acceptable to enslave fellow Europeans but intensively participated in the slave trade 
69
for people of African and Asian descent.  
 
Moreover, while slavery has not been adjudicated upon in court proceedings, trafficking as part 
70
of enslavement has been tried in the already-mentioned Kunarac case before the ICTY. The 
Trial Chamber in that case considered the exercise of ownership of the persons and the duration 
of the suspected exercise of powers, both of which are extensively present in enslavement due 
to the long-term ownership of persons.

 Yet the non-applicability of the statute of limitations operates within the limits of the court’s jurisdiction, which 
is qualified by the non-retroactivity rule ratione personae (Art. 24 ICC St: no one can be held criminally 
responsible for the crimes committed before the statute’s entry into force).
