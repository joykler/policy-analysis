of the annihilation of six million Jews by the Nazis has been criminalised by an impressive 
number of states either as hate speech (incitement to hatred, Volksverhetzung) or as a self-
55
standing crime of genocide denial. The list of subsequent show trials, beyond Germany, most 
56
famously includes the proceedings against James Keegstra (1984) , Ernst Zündel in Canada 
57
(1985) , and the lengthy libel case against American historian Deborah Lipstadt, brought by 
58
Holocaust denier David Irving. In this regard, the most eminent precedent in international law 
is the 1996 decision of the UN Human Rights Committee, which upheld the conviction of the 
59
French scholar Robert Faurisson.  
 
Apart from demonstrating respect by acknowledging the suffering of millions of Jewish 
victims, the criminalisation of Holocaust denial after World War II has transformed social 
reality and led to a global spread of memory laws in two ways:  
 
(a) Alongside the prohibition on Nazi memorabilia, symbols and literature (bringing 
60
other major restrictions on freedom of speech), Holocaust denial laws have shaped a 
monumental dichotomist vision of World War II: the absolutised guilt of Nazi Germans 
and their collaborators stands in contrast to the praise of the winning allies.  
 
(b) These memory laws have become instrumental to the politics of 
Vergangenheitsbewältigung (coming to terms with past) in Germany and other 
61
countries.

While the Netherlands agreed to abolish slavery by royal decree in 1814, international law 
th
only began regulating enslavement from the early 20 century with the Slavery Convention of 
63
1926 (ratified by the Netherlands in 1955). This instrument was succeeded by the 
Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and 
 
The Nuremberg trial was mainly about punishing war crimes and so-called crimes against peace (aggressive war) 
that had been robustly codified in the Hague Regulations of the early 1900s and in the Briand Kellogg Pact of 
1928. But protection of civilians anywhere was underdeveloped in 1945, which came later with the introduction 
of the 1951 Geneva Conventions and the Genocide Convention (1948—in force 1951). Hence, it is worth 
emphasising the lack of accountability for genocide at Nuremberg. Today academic literature mentions the 
Armenian, Herero, American Indian and other genocides, but never in the context of judicial settlement that would 
involve retroactive application of the legal category of genocide to these facts.

 Volksverhetzung is a criminal offence under Section 130 of the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch) in Germany. 
Similar provisions about incitement of group hatred have been enshrined in most of the continental European 
criminal codes. In Germany, it can lead to up to five years imprisonment. For many years that criminal clause was 
interpreted as covering Holocaust denial, while in the 1990s special provisions on Holocaust denial as well as, 
most recently, on justifying or glorifying the Nazi government were added. Similar self-standing (i.e. separate 
from ‘hate speech’) provisions on Holocaust denial exist these days in various countries, from Israel to France.

 To give just one, out of many European examples, s 86a (use of symbols of the unconstitutional organizations) 
of the German Criminal Code outlaws Nazi symbols and insignia.

 The Convention to Suppress the Slave Trade and Slavery (1926) was an international treaty. Created under the 
auspices of the League of nations. The Convention was amended by the protocol entering into force on 7 July 
1955, available at: https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/SlaveryConvention.aspx.
