engagement with the victimhood argument, visible in the preparatory work for the Taubira law, 
in particular. The purpose of the law is entirely genuine from the standpoint of a culprit state 
voluntarily recognising its colonial atrocities of the past. Yet the French legislative efforts to 
frame its colonial legacy have been accused of carrying more symbolism and anachronistic 
selectivity of the past victimhood as well as for blaming everything exclusively on white 
Europeans, and thus, setting up a simplified dichotomic vision of the colonial past,  in order to 
131
present a politically constructed idyllic image on the international stage.  
 
4.2 Memory laws in Poland 
 
Beyond France, the protagonist of the terminology of memory laws, the adoption of memory 
regulations has risen tremendously in Europe in the 2010-2020s under the pretext of 
132
counteracting historical disinformation, specifically in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). 
Furthermore, their mushrooming in CEE, in particular in Poland, has been intertwined with a 
certain democratic decline in the region and the so-called “memory wars”, whereas states have 
been attempting to challenge their divergent views on the matters of past atrocities, Soviet 
occupation and the division of borders by virtue of mutually contrasting legislation on historical 
133
memory. While Polish memory laws, unlike in the French example, did not directly address 
the legacies of colonialism, this country study is particularly relevant for exposing the caveats 
of censorship embedded in both punitive and non-punitive memory laws, and for explaining 
how an expansive governance of historical memory by virtue of memory laws can spoil foreign 
relations and affect minorities.

After the fall of communism, Poland adopted a new Constitution only in 1997 and a Criminal 
135
Code in 1998. Both the Constitution and the Criminal Code outlawed the propagation of 
fascism and other totalitarian ideologies – a standard clause found in many Council of Europe 
136
Member States. In line with other post-communist transitional democracies in CEE, Poland 
expanded the core of this ban to cover the propagation of ideas and methods of totalitarian 
137 138
Stalinist and communist regimes. This ban included the display of relevant symbols. In 
2016, the Polish parliament adopted the Law that prohibited the propagation of communism

 The right to ban the names and symbols of undemocratic regimes from public spaces is recognised by 
international and European human rights bodies, including the UN Human Right Committee, the Council of 
Europe’s Venice Commission and the European Court of Human Rights. Such legislation, however, must pass an 
obligatory test of lawfulness, proportionality, and necessity in a democratic society. States are given a wide margin 
of appreciation to choose adequate policies, depending on country-specific circumstances and the historical 
experiences of their citizens.
