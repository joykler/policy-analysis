Abstract 
In May and June 2021, three sessions were held with a cross 
section of Saban residents, including the youth (represented 
by members of the Saba Youth Council on 22 May 2021), 
Public Entity of Saba (represented by members of the 
Executive and Island Councils on 20 May 2021), and 
representatives of the Saba community (including NGOs and 
other stakeholders on 1 June 2021) to discuss the impact of 
slavery on Saba. The goal was to discuss the 
views/perceptions/opinions of Sabans on the history of 
slavery on Saba and how it may have and continue to affect 
certain segments of the society, or the society in general. This 
is a difficult and controversial issue for public discussion 
across the region and world, so it was approached with the 
utmost care to ensure that everyone felt comfortable to 
express their views in a safe environment. All three sessions 
were cordial and had a high level of discourse from which the 
following recommendations were made as to possible ways 
the government of the Netherlands could address the issue 
of the impact of slavery on Saba and help in creating a more 
harmonious island society.
