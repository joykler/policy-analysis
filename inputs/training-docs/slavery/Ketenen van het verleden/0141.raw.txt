and other totalitarian regimes through names of buildings, objects, and public service devices, 
139
dubbed the ‘street de-communization law’ (2016 Law). The 2016 Law was adopted by the 
140
votes of the governing ‘Law and Justice’ party (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość, further PiS). In 
141
2017, the Law was amended to incorporate the removal of monuments.  
 
Under the 2016 Law, local authorities were obliged to rename locations that propagated 
communism as defined in the Law and according to a list prepared by the Institute of National 
Remembrance (Instytut Pamięci Narodowej, further IPN), a public history research institution 
with prosecutorial powers to investigate crimes against Polish citizens. The IPN was created in 
1998 to specifically investigate the crimes of the Nazi and Soviet regimes. Since its creation, it 
has become a true ‘Ministry of History’ with quasi-legislative powers and a yearly budget that 
142
is five times higher than that of the Polish Academy of Sciences. In accordance with the 2016 
Law, the IPN drafted a list of 130 locations to be renamed within twelve months of the entry 
into force on 1 September 2016. If local authorities failed to comply with the requirement before 
this date, provincial governors (wojewodowie) who represent the central government in Polish 
provinces (województwa) were obliged to issue an administrative decision, a so-called 
replacement ordinance (zarządzenie zastępcze), and rename streets within three months after 
the expiry of the initial period prescribed by the Law. To limit the arbitrariness of the ordinance, 
provincial governors were required to consult with the IPN in relation to the renaming of 
locations. The 2016 Law permitted local councils to overrule provincial governors’ 
administrative decisions in a regular vote within three months of the proposed name change.  
 
Apart from the 2016 Law, the most prominent Polish memory law regarding World War II is a 
January 2018 amendment to the 1998 law that established the IPN (subsequently amended again 
143
in June 2018). The Amendment criminalised statements contrary to established historical 
facts about the involvement of the Polish State in the atrocities of World War II. It introduced 
a new power for the IPN to investigate ‘crimes of Ukrainian nationalists’ committed between 
1920 and 1950, and extended the temporal mandate of the IPN to the documentation and 
investigation of crimes and gross human rights violations against Polish nationals and citizens 
committed between 8 November 1917 and 31 July 1989. The 2018 Amendment had a practical 
impact on the IPN’s responsibilities as well as a symbolic impact. Paradigmatic expressions of
