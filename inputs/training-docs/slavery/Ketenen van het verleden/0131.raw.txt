fact, scope, mechanisms (for example, gas chambers), or intentionality of the genocide of the 
Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices 
during World War II (‘Holocaust’).  
 
The case law of the ECtHR reveals that the Court has traditionally tackled the issue of Holocaust 
denial on the basis of Article 17 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) (finding 
the violation at stake incompatible with the Convention’s values as such) instead of engaging 
in detailed proportionality assessments (as in hate speech cases) based on Article 10 of the 
74
ECHR (freedom of speech). Two German cases in Strasbourg are particularly emblematic of 
75 76
this approach: Hoffer and Annen v Germany (2011) and PETA v Germany (2012). In Hoffer 
& Annen, applicants were prosecuted for anti-abortion leaflets comparing the ‘Babycaust’ to 
the Holocaust. In PETA v Germany, PETA, an animals rights association, was defending its 
artistic campaign (‘the Holocaust on your plate’), where pictures of animals in stocks were 
contrasted with images of inmates in concentration camps. The ECtHR upheld the decision of 
the domestic courts in both cases, maintaining that the leaflets and the advertisement trivialized 
the sufferings of the Holocaust victims and, therefore, the prohibitive measure was found 
proportional to freedom of speech (protected under Article 10 of the ECHR). Most interestingly 
from a comparative perspective, the analogous campaign had been carried out in the USA in 
the same manner, without serious legal challenges.  
 
At the end of 2013, the ECtHR delivered an impressively extensive judgment in the case 
77
Perinçek v Switzerland. ; it declared that the condemnation of a Turkish politician by Swiss 
courts for the denial of the Armenian genocide was a violation of freedom of expression. During 
his 2005 visit to Switzerland, Turkish politician Dr Doğu Perinçek gave several public speeches 
alleging the existence of conspiracies against Turks and an ‘international lie’ about the 
Armenian genocide. According to Perinçek, the scope and nature of atrocities against 
Armenians in the Ottoman Empire cannot be deemed genocide. Swiss courts found Perinçek 
guilty of the criminal offence of genocide denial. On 15 October 2015, the Grand Chamber of 
78
the ECtHR delivered its final judgment in the case. The outcome in the Grand Chamber is 
79
similar to the previous decision of the Chamber on this case in 2013. The Swiss criminal 
provision applied in the context of the denial of the Armenian genocide was again found 
irreconcilable with freedom of expression under Article 10 of the ECHR. While the 2013 
decision focused mainly on Article 10 ECHR, striking a balance between freedom of speech 
(paragraph 1 of Article 10 ECHR) and its legitimate limitations (paragraph 2 of Article 10 
ECHR), in its 2015 judgment, the Grand Chamber assessed the conflict between the protection 
of dignity for the Armenian community (Article 8 ECHR) and the freedom of speech for 
Perinçek (Article 10 ECHR). The Grand Chamber withdrew from determining whether 
“massacres and mass deportations” suffered by the Armenian people at the hands of the 
Ottoman Empire could be referred to as genocide. In contrast, the Grand Chamber focused on 
the dignity of both the victims and the present-day Armenian community as a possible 
legitimate aim in justifying the Swiss criminal provision. To support its argument, the Court 
 
(FRA) and disseminated on its website and to its national monitors. Units of the Organization for Security and Co-
operation in Europe (OSCE) concerned with combating anti-Semitism also employ the definition.

no 9777/82); FP v Germany (App no 19459/92); Honsik v Austria (App no 25062/94); Remer v Germany (App no 
25096/94); Nachtmann v Austria (App no 36773/97); Witzsch v Germany (App no 41448/98).
