building straightforwardly outlaws denial, trivialisation, and minimisation of certain atrocities 
96
by virtue of the adoption of Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA in 2008. One of the 
underlining ideas for the harmonisation of the EU approach to hate speech (and historical 
revisionism) is similar to that of the harmonisation of the internal market: the goal to prevent 
97
(racist) groups from moving to countries with less restrictive legislation.  
 
98
The proposal for this harmonised EU ban on hate speech appeared in 2001. It took seven years 
99
until it was adopted under the German presidency in November 2008. The deliberations of 
Member States perfectly echo the fundamental controversy of excluding certain types of 
expression. In 2001, only ten of the current EU countries had criminal provisions on Holocaust 
denial (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, 
Slovakia and Spain). Several other countries regarded the problem within the realm of hate 
speech, conjoining Holocaust denial with discrimination against Jews or incitement of violence. 
In other countries ‘revisionist ideologies’ could be punished under general criminal provisions 
dealing with the maintenance of public peace or those addressing statements and behaviour 
100
motivated by racist intent. Moreover, at least in one EU country (Spain), the constitutional 
court held the clause penalising genocide denial in the Criminal Code incompatible with the 
101
constitutional right to freedom of speech.  
 
The EU Framework Decision is worded as an open norm which leaves room for interpretation. 
102
Yet the broadness in formulation poses the risk of inducing a chilling effect in the 
 
96
 EU Council Framework Decision on Combating Certain Forms and Expressions of Racism and Xenophobia by 
Means of Criminal Law, 2008/913/JHA. For a detailed account of the controversial history of the Decision’s 
adoption, see Mark Bell, Racism and Equality in the European Union, OUP, 2008. 164–68. In addition to these 
developments on hate speech and historical revisionism, EU secondary law also contains the so-called EU Race 
Equality Directive (2000), prohibiting discrimination of racial and ethnical minorities at the labour market. On 26 
March 2019, the European Parliament adopted for the first time a resolution on the Fundamental Rights of People 
of African Descent. The Parliament calls on Member States and EU institutions to recognise that people of African 
descent are subjected to racism, discrimination and xenophobia, and that they are entitled to protection from this 
unequal treatment, both as individuals and as a group. The resolution further calls for positive measures so that 
people of African descent in Europe can fully and equally enjoy their rights.

 Point 5 in the preamble to the Council Framework Decision on Combating Certain Forms and Expression of 
Racism and Xenophobia by Means of Criminal Law, 2008/913/JHA, suggests that ‘it is necessary to define a 
common criminal-law approach in the European Union to this phenomenon in order to ensure that the same 
behaviour constitutes an offence in all Member States and that effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties 
are provided for natural and legal persons having committed or being liable for such offences.’

 COM (2001) 664 final, [2002] OJ C 75E, submitted by the Commission on 29 November 2001. The seminal 
idea for criminalisation stems from the earlier Council Joint Action 96/443/JHA of 15 July 1996 concerning action 
to combat racism and xenophobia (OJ L 185, 24 July 1996). The latter instrument is now obsolete.

 A chilling effect may be caused by legal actions such as the passing of a law, the decision of a court, or the threat 
of a lawsuit; any legal action that would cause people to hesitate to exercise a legitimate right (freedom of speech 
or otherwise) for fear of legal repercussions. When that fear is brought about by the threat of a libel lawsuit, it is 
 
called libel chill. In the context of American law, a lawsuit initiated specifically for the purpose of creating a 
chilling effect may be called a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation ("SLAPP").
