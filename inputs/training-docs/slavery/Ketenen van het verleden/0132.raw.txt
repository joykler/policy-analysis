assessed four divergent legal modes existing within the CoE with regard to genocide denials: 
1) some states do not have a criminalizing clause; 2) others penalize just Holocaust denials; 3) 
there are those who punish the denial of both Nazi and communist crimes; and 4) there are 
80
states that punish the Armenian genocide denial and denials of similar historical injustices.  
 
Five central arguments guided considerations of the Grand Chamber on Perinçek’s denial of 
the Armenian genocide. First, the applicant’s statements, according to the Court, bore on an 
81
issue of public interest and did not amount to a call for hatred or intolerance. Second, the 
context in which they were made had not been marked by heightened tension or special 
82
historical overtones in Switzerland. Third, the statements could not be regarded as affecting 
the dignity of the members of the Armenian community to the point of requiring a criminal law 
83
response in Switzerland. Fourth, there was no international law obligation on Switzerland to 
84
criminalize such statements. Fifth, the Swiss courts appeared to have censured Perinçek 
simply for voicing an opinion that diverged from the established ones in Switzerland, and the 
interference with his right to freedom of expression had taken the serious form of a criminal 
85
conviction. Finally, the Court considered the lapse of time between the applicant’s statements 
and the events of 1915, specifying that an enhanced degree of regulation of such statements is 
86
bound to recede with the passage of time. The Grand Chamber, thus, found that Switzerland 
had used the legitimate aim of dignity-protection to disproportionally limit freedom of speech, 
and therefore, sustained a violation of Article 10 ECHR. Nonetheless, the Court refused to grant 
87
Perinçek any of the financial compensation he requested.  
 
The ECtHR is not a criminal tribunal and, therefore, it was not obliged to answer – and, in fact, 
it has not answered – the question of whether mass massacres of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey 
amounted to genocide. Despite a substantial number of concurring opinions by judges of the 
ECtHR clearly recognizing the Armenian genocide, the question remains as to whether states 
can legitimately criminalize only the denial of the Holocaust in contrast to the negation of other 
historical atrocities, including the denial of colonial atrocities. From the judgment, it appears 
that the Court is unwilling to grant a wide margin of appreciation to states criminalizing 
genocide denial further than Holocaust denial. Almost thirty countries, as well as several 
international organizations like the CoE itself and the European Union, have recognized the 
88
Armenian genocide through various forms of soft law. While recognizing and prohibiting the 
denial of a recognized fact are clearly two different legal modes, the judgment exposes a 
divergent governance of memory in European law and its contradictory relationship with 
89
freedom of speech.
