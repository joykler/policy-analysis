Background 
The island of Saba, despite its small size, was settled by Europeans in the 1640s after 
millennia of occupation by Indigenous peoples (Hofman and Hoogland 2016). It thereafter 
became a Dutch colony (though occasionally captured/occupied by the British and French), 
and as with all of the islands of the Caribbean, embarked on some form of agriculture 
utilizing captive Africans as an enslaved labor force in every aspect of life (Espersen 2017). 
It must be emphasized that Saba lacked the resources (especially land) and investments 
necessary to create and sustain the extensive plantation economies as was the case on the 
neighboring islands where large numbers of captive Africans, oftentimes in the majority, 
were enslaved on plantations generating large quantities of agricultural products for export 
to European markets via extensive trading networks. 
There is, however, ample evidence that Saba maintained several small plantations 
producing indigo (evidenced at Cove Bay and Spring Bay), sugar cane (evidenced at Spring 
Bay, Flat Point and The Bottom), quicklime (at Cove Bay), and livestock for periods 
th th
(particularly in the 17 and 18 centuries) that utilized enslaved Africans, primarily as field 
laborers (Espersen 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019; Lafoon et al. 2018). The majority of enslaved 
Africans, however, were employed in other economic activities, particularly as domestic 
servants, in fisheries, seafaring (inter-island trade), and everyday manual labor. As such, 
Saba always maintained a population of captive Africans and their descendants as enslaved 
laborers that numbered in the hundreds for many years during the period of slavery, usually 
amounting to between 33 to 50 percent of the total population (Espersen 2017, 2019). 
At Emancipation in 1863, there were 734 enslaved recorded and granted their freedom by 
the Dutch government, alongside the compensation received by their former owners for 
that freedom (for the list of enslaved, their former owners, and the monetary compensations 
see Espersen 2017:395-415; Johnson 2012). Though Saba was, and for many years, 
characterized as a poor colony relative to its neighbors and thus lacked extensive resources 
and wealth, it was nonetheless a slave society where a plurality (between 30 and 50 percent) 
of the free population owned enslaved and used them to survive and create wealth, some of 
them owning scores of enslaved people at a time, but most owning between 1 and 5 enslaved 
(Espersen 2017). Both enslaved and enslaver worked and lived in close proximity to each
