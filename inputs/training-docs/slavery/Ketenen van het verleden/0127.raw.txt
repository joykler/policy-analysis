commonly conducted at the level of city governance and municipalities, rather than at state 
46
level. Should there be a political will to adopt a consensusrijkswet in this area, the law can 
assign the Kingdom designation to such institutions (e.g., Koninkrijksmuseum voor koloniale 
geschiedenis), unless the attribution of the Kingdom status itself is to be viewed by the Advisory 
Board as bearing colonial connotations. Furthermore, some of these institutions may even be 
established beyond the Netherlands, in three other autonomous countries. The positive aspect 
of this choice pertains to involving the constituent countries of the Kingdom (three of which 
are former colonies too) into the legislative dialogue about the colonial past, shaping a 
consolidated narrative for the descendants of the culprits of colonialism and descendants of 
their victims. The downside of this choice is possibly slowing down the legislative process and 
reinforcing difficulties in finding consensus on the formulation of the material and temporal 
scope of this legislation. Considering the recent political tensions between the Netherlands and 
47
some of the autonomous countries in the Caribbean (e.g. Curaçao), it is possible that adoption 
of such law may interfere with other issues, e.g. regarding the budget.  
 
3. Legal governance of historical memory in international and European law  
 
3.1 International law (including analysis of slavery as a crime against humanity)  
 
The duty to remember achieved its legal embodiment primarily in the aftermath of World War 
II, with subsequent criminal proceedings, most notably during the international military tribunal 
48 49
in Nuremberg (1945–1946), the Israeli trials of Adolf Eichmann (1961) and Ivan Demjanjuk 
50 51
(1986–1988), and the French trial of Klaus Barbie (1987). These trials gave sense to the new 
52
crime entering international law under the heading of genocide. The United Nations General 
Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide 
53
on 9 December 1948 as General Assembly Resolution 260. Not only was it the first crime 
with a retroactive effect, the subsequent prohibition on Holocaust denial in various countries 
set the most widespread example of legal regulation of memory. However, it should be noted 
taking the example of Nuremberg, that the crime of genocide did not even feature in the 
54
Nuremberg Charter, nor in the final judgement. Denial, minimisation, and gross trivialisation

 Genocide only received a minor mention in the Nuremberg Indictment thanks to Lemkin, but the Tribunal did 
not deal with it because of the retroactivity problem. The same goes to a large extent for crimes against humanity.
