the historical policy of the current ‘Law and Justice’ government, this amendment also reflects 
the government’s approach to democratic norms and political process, including the exercise 
144
of rights and civil liberties.  
 
This memory policies resulted in the domestic and international outcry briefly mentioned 
above. In particular, the Law caused a deterioration of Polish-Israeli relations on an 
unprecedented scale since Poland’s transition to democracy in 1989. International media 
frequently referred to the 2018 Law as the ‘Holocaust law’, which may incorrectly insinuate 
that the Law introduced criminal prohibitions on the denial of the Holocaust in the Polish legal 
system, or new, related legislation with a parallel aim. However, the 2018 Law belongs to an 
entirely different category of criminal memory laws. It is an insult law which aims to protect 
the reputation of abstract entities such as the State and the nation. The Law introduced a new 
system of criminal and civil means, which were adopted to counter allegedly defamatory 
statements about the Polish State and the nation’s involvement in World War II atrocities when 
such statements were considered to be contrary to established historical facts and disparage the 
reputation of Poles and their country. 
 
The 2018 Law initially amended the 1998 law that established the IPN, adding, inter alia, 
Article 55a, Clause 1, which states: 
 
Whoever accuses, publicly and against the facts, the Polish nation, or the Polish state, 
of being responsible or complicit in the Nazi crimes committed by the Third German 
Reich or other crimes against peace and humanity, or war crimes, or otherwise grossly 
diminishes the actual perpetrators thereof, shall be subject to a fine or a penalty of 
145
imprisonment of up to three years.  
 
Clause 2 of the 2018 Law also stipulates that persons who ‘act unintentionally’ may be liable 
to punishment. Clause 3 introduced artistic and scientific exceptions: ‘the perpetrator of the 
offence referred to in clauses 1 and 2 is not committing a crime if he or she commits such an 
146
act as part of artistic or scientific activities.’  
 
The 2018 Law is the Polish government’s second attempt to introduce a specific criminal 
offence of defaming the State and nation. The first attempt was temporarily successful in 2006 
when Article 132a was incorporated into the Criminal Code of the Republic of Poland. The 
Article provided: ‘[…] whoever publicly slanders the Polish Nation for participating, 
organizing or being responsible for communist or Nazi crimes, is subject to a restriction of 
liberty up to 3 years’. The Polish Human Rights Commissioner raised concerns about the 
compatibility of Article 132a with the Constitution and referred the provision to the Polish 
147
Constitutional Tribunal. In a ruling handed down in 2008, the Constitutional Tribunal found 
148
the provision to be incompatible with the Polish Constitution on procedural grounds. The
